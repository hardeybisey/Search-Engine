        "abstract": "Waqf received research attention due to its ability to contribute to socio-economic development. While a high volume of literary evidence on this Islamic social finance instrument is available, the research motivation and study findings are diverse. Therefore, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of waqf literature to understand the pattern and direction of research on Waqf broadly. We collect 319 articles, and reviews on Waqf extracted from the Scopus database, covering a period exceeding 100 years from 1914 until June 2020. We employ RStudio, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel for citation analysis, content, and network analyses. A systematic review of recent publications complemented the bibliometric analysis. Alongside revealing the most relevant scientific actors in waqf literature, most researchers on Waqf were from Malaysia; they conducted studies widely on cash Waqf. As a result, we identify four research themes for waqf studies which include (1) Cash Waqf endowment, (2) Islamic accountability and Waqf, (3) Waqf and Islamic social finance, and (4) Governance for Waqf endowment. This is the first study to provide a bibliometric review of waqf literature to address gaps in the existing research and offer directions for future research which could benefit early-career Islamic finance researchers.",

        "abstract": "This study assessed the factors that determine the financial management behavior of administrators in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Nigeria. The rising cases of financial mismanagement, which was associated with the financial management behavior of top administrators in these SOEs, prompted this study. It is believed that identifying the factors that determine the financial management behavior of these administrators would help to find solutions to the problem. Based on the multistage sampling technique, 385 top administrators from the SOEs at the federal level in Nigeria participated in the survey. Quantitative analysis was used to analyze the data and the results show that income, family size, and financial literacy are the most important factors affecting the financial management behavior of the administrators. It is recommended that there should be an improvement in income and other working conditions of the administrators in the SOEs since income has been confirmed to be an important shift factor of financial management behavior. In the same vein, given the role of family size, it is recommended that efforts on population reduction should be intensified. Finally, financial literacy should be given priority in checkmating irresponsible financial management behavior.",

        "abstract": "This study uncovers the impact of the COVID-19 on the Islamic equity markets compared to their conventional counterparts. The extremely large-scale drawdown across the markets signifies an indiscriminate impact. To some extent, Asian Islamic markets show relative resilience to their counterparts. Both Islamic and non-Islamic Asian markets signpost a quicker recovery than the rest of the regions, the Middle East & Africa, Europe, and America. It appears that a higher return leads to a smaller maximum drawdown, while higher volatility leads to a larger maximum drawdown. Despite the large-scale drawdown, a number of markets secure a positive return where Islamic markets outperform the counterparts. Conventional markets respond to the COVID-19 aftershock homogenously as a result of their high interlinkages. Collectively, these results reinforce the view that in the crisis period, Islamic markets are more resilient.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThe objective of this paper is to investigate the validity of stock valuation theories and their forecasting ability by conducting an empirical study. It employs four most commonly used theories which are then tested using 19-year banking-firm market data. The usefulness of these models demonstrates with promising results.Design/methodology/approachThis paper conducts a multi-country study using the multi-model testing approach to evaluate validity of theories and forecast accuracy of banking firms. It employs four methodology models used in finance literature; (1) P/E multiples model, (2) accounting-information-based clean surplus model, (3) theoretical model based on Gordon and Shapiro (1956) method and (4) the Damodaran-Kottler Free Cash Flow or FCF theory based on discounting model.FindingsThe tests show that the four theories under tests have a significant fit with actual price formation. The explained variation ranges from 72 to 92%, so the explanatory power of the theories accounting for variations in bank prices over 19-year period is substantial. The models fit suggest that the P/E model has superior predictive power followed by the RIM, DDM and FCFE. These findings shed new lights on the relative performance of valuation models.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is limited in terms of the sample period size for 1999\u20132019. The availability of essential financial data prior to 2000 is very limited, so one can understand interpretation of statistical results under certain assumptions.Practical implicationsThe paper suggests that one-factor model is better than the two-factor model.Originality/valueThe work done in this paper is unpublished and original contribution to banking and finance literature and also not under consideration for publication in any other journal.",

        "abstract": "This paper systematically reviews 314 empirical studies which examine the relationship between board leadership structure and firm performance. The results show that the mixed research findings are due to different firm performance measurements, research designs, sampling practices and approaches of dealing with endogeneity issues. Studies utilizing multiple-country data, multinational companies, small firms or regions covering Africa, the Middle East, Eastern-Europe and South America are under-represented. It critiques the methodological weaknesses of some empirical studies and proposes that future researchers should use multiple firm performance measurements, a longitudinal research design, and an integrative framework to better control the direct and moderating factors. Future researchers may advance the robustness of research by using multiple theoretical lenses to consider how various governance factors moderate the relationship between board leadership structure and firm performance, particularly the different ownership structures, managerial discretion contexts and national institutional factors.

Adopting theoretical arguments on personal working experience, we hypothesize that CEOs\u2019 general financial experience may not have a significant impact on their decisions to manipulate earnings while specific experience in audit committee functions will put them in an advantageous position to inflate earnings. Our findings, based on the analysis of 545 UK firms that undertook M&A during 2001-2018, are consistent with these hypotheses. Further investigation reveals that CEOs experienced in audit committees are able to manage earnings as they have specific knowledge on how to reduce the committees\u2019 independence. Our study contributes to the current debate on the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms by highlighting the importance of specificity of CEOs\u2019 experience. ",

Using a sample of the FTSE All-Share Index firms listed on the London Stock Exchange for the period 2009 to 2018 and the ordinary least squares regression (OLS) estimation method, we find that cost of debt is higher for firms with CEOs in their early tenure in office than those in their later tenure in office. Further analysis shows that board independence attributes including (1) the proportion of independent directors on the board, (2) full (100%) independent audit committee members, and (3) a lead independent director representation on the board interact with CEO early tenure in office to reduce cost of debt due to the board\u2019s effective monitoring ability when the CEO is new and risk-seeking. Our study extends CEO tenure and corporate outcomes in general and in particular CEO risk-taking incentives and cost of debt literature, and has important implications for firms seeking to raise finance from the debt market when their CEO is new as well as identifying the control mechanisms that they need to put in place to lower the cost of debt.",

        "abstract": "Within the context of a target oil price band regime, this paper posits that cheating behaviour in OPEC has ethical and accountability implications for the organisation. It also impacts on its reputation and ability to ensure stable and fair oil prices in the oil markets. Based on datasets covering the period from 2000 to 2012 (i.e. production quota era), analysed using the vector autoregression/vector error correction (VAR-VEC) framework, the study\u2019s results indicate that OPEC cheating, mainly instigated by the amount of spare production capacity available to OPEC members, does not seem to have a significant direct effect on international oil prices. However, the degree of cheating by OPEC member-states might disrupt its ability to maintain surplus capacity enough to reduce price speculation in the oil markets. Should cheating behaviour in OPEC continue unabated, this could jeopardise an effective energy regulatory framework and market transparency. The paper, therefore, recommends a policy action in OPEC to support the redesigning of the existing quota system that is fair and just to its members and capable of controlling any cheating behaviour.

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper examines the historical evolvement of competing institutional logics (i.e. religion, profession, state, market and community) underpinning Islamic accounting standardisation projects and power relations between internal actors representing these logics.Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a case-study approach and analyses two Islamic accounting standardisation projects implemented at the national and international levels. Documentary review and semi-structured interviews are used for data collection. Analysis is informed by the \u2018Institutional Logics Perspective\u2019 and Bourdieu\u2019s notion of \u2018power as capital in a field\u2019.Findings: Research findings illustrate how some local actors pre-dispose themselves in promoting strict compliance to IFRS, while others endeavour to ensure compliance to \u2018Islamic Sharia requirements\u2019 in financial reporting. In this power dynamic, there is an ongoing \u2018constructive resistance\u2019 actively exerted by the latter group against the former, preserving the existence of religion-based reporting demands in Islamic accounting standardisation approaches. The paper also highlights chronological \u2018dynamic\u2019 accounts that explain the evolvement of institutional logics prevailing in these projects over different historical stages at both national and international levels.Originality/value: This paper\u2019s findings contrast and challenge the existing assumption that the \u2018epistemic community\u2019 promoting IFRS agenda always faces \u2018passive responses\u2019 from local actors.

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to examine the compliance status of Islamic banks in Bangladesh with Shari\u2019ah-based accounting standards named Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) standard-4 and its association with corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: The six years of secondary data, including the annual reports of 2013\u20132018, were collected from the websites of all the seven listed Islamic banks, i.e. 100% of the population available during the period of study. The study used a content analysis approach for systematically categorizing and analysing the contents disclosed in the annual report. A total compliance score based on 133 reporting items of IFSB standard-4 were considered for content analysis. Furthermore, this study applied the ordinary least square to investigate the impact of corporate governance on IFSB standard-4. Findings: This study found that the level of compliance with the IFSB standard by the Islamic banks in Bangladesh is poor, as the overall compliance status is 44.83%. Further, this study observed a significant and positive influence of the Shari\u2019ah supervisory committee, the board size, accounting experts on the board, foreign ownership and institutional ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4. On the other hand, this study found a negative effect of directors\u2019 ownership on the level of compliance with IFSB standard-4. Practical implications: This study provides the management of Islamic banks an insight into developing their governance characteristics to comply with Islamic accounting and reporting standards. Moreover, this study expects to facilitate the management of Islamic banks in designing their accounting and reporting outlines to enhance the level of compliance with the IFSB standards. Originality/value: This pioneering study on IFSB standards opens an avenue to the researchers exploring the accounting and reporting status of Islamic banks considering the requirements of the IFSB standards.",

We hypothesize that firms utilizing financial derivative instruments reduce the stock return volatility which is priced in investors\u2019 expectations. While financial risk hedging serves as a vehicle for firms to alleviate cash flows volatility, it also leads to economic benefits to the firm value in case of the presence of increasing asymmetric information. In addition, we hypothesize and test whether the nature of relation between financial risk hedging and cost of equity capital varies and is more negative or more ambiguous with economic shocks. Our results show that engaging in financial risk hedging enables firms to have a lower cost of capital. Consistent with the extant literature, we control for potential endogeneity problems and sample selection bias using instrumental variables and treatment effects approaches. Thus, our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, including the use of multiple estimation methods and alternative proxies of cost of equity measures. Overall, our findings suggest that the value of financial hedging decisions increases during economic shocks, and if financial constraints become more severe and if cash flows volatility increases.",

However, despite a few prior studies acknowledging the negative externalities of political activity, little attention has been paid to CPA\u2019s dark side. In this paper, we draw on institutional and corporate governance insights to examine the relationship between CPA and bribery, which is arguably the greatest institutional failure in developing countries. Using pooled data from over 25,000 firms in 41 African countries, we find that lobbying and firm-level bribery are positively related. This relationship is weakened by in-country internet penetration and foreign ownership of firms. Taken together, the results suggest that business-government relations in weak institutional environments help to perpetuate corruption. They also suggest that internet penetration and foreign ownership help to illuminate the dark side of CPA. Leveraging this understanding, we make important contributions to the literature and highlight pertinent practical implications.      ",

Similarly, it enhanced the return on capital for product-based firms while reducing them for service-based firms. In contrast, social activities have a significant negative impact on the stock price of the product and service-based listed firms. Likewise, social performance has a significant negative impact on the return on capital of service-based firms listed on LSE. However, we find an insignificant relationship between governance disclosure and the stock price and the return on capital for product and service-based firms.

Using a cross-section of 21,954 firms from 47 African countries, the study estimates several multivariate models to examine the factors that are associated with the decision of firms to register at the start of their operation and the length of time to remain unregistered. The findings show that entrepreneurship in the informal sector is complex and context-bound as contextual factors unique to Africa, such as, corruption, political instability, crime rate, infrastructure (electricity and transportation), access to land and finance, influence the entrepreneur\u2019s decision to register their firm at the start of its operation. The length of time firms remain unregistered is shown to be positively correlated to access to finance and infrastructural availability and negatively related to crime and political instability.

Our findings also show that vigorous legal enforcement and shareholder protection regimes promote the early adoption of ISAs, whereas robust judicial efficiency systems constrain the early adoption of ISAs. In addition, our results show that higher literacy rates and educational attainment simulate the earlier diffusion of ISAs. We also find that higher levels of individualism and uncertainty avoidance, but low levels of power distance cultural values, boost the early adoption of ISAs. Finally, our results report that countries with strong political stability and control of corruption tend to adopt ISAs faster than those with solid government effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "We examine the association between ownership structure and dividend payout policy in a family firms dominated economy. More specifically, we test whether family firms pay higher dividend compared to counter non-family firms in Bangladesh. We argue that family firms are more likely to pay higher dividend to display lower agency problems between controlling family and minority shareholders. Using 993 firm-year observations from 2011-2019, we find that, consistent with our arguments, family firms distribute higher dividend compared to non-family firms to mitigate expropriation concern of non-controlling shareholders. This study contributes to family business literature and provides policy implications in the sense that regulators understand the importance of ownership structure and how it affects firms\u2019 dividend payout policy that serves shareholders\u2019 interests.",

        "abstract": "Strong demographic headwinds have motivated Japan to strengthen its economy by fostering innovation. This paper draws on a panel of business enterprises operating in 33 industries in Japan to examine how research and development (R&D) activities affect employment. Our findings suggest that employment gains are associated with innovation, both at the aggregate level and within groups of major industries. The positive impact of technological advancement is more pronounced in the manufacturing sector. The results reveal heterogeneous patterns of the key determinants of employment growth based on the level of industries' routine intensity, but they accord well with the compensation theory concerning the connection between innovation and job creation. These results will be of interest for policymakers to design targeted economic strategies by supporting technological development in Japan and could also serve as a compass for other countries with similar workforce structures and macroeconomic characteristics.",

Using a large sample comprised of 15,138 observations from A-share firms traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that government ownership has a positive impact on R&D investment decisions. Furthermore, a supplementary test confirms that government ownership has also a positive impact on board monitoring intensity, as measured by the frequency of board meetings. This study injects the literature with fresh evidence on the role of state ownership in R&D investment in China, especially after the most recent wave of privatization, namely Split-Share Structure Reform (SSSR) which started in 2005. The results of this study have implications for different stakeholders as they do not support the common impression regarding the negative impact of state ownership on business outcomes.",

Using a fixed-effect model on 2,260 companies\u2019 annual data from 2012 to 2017, we analyze whether female board members influence CSR performance. The results indicate that the proportion of female board directors (PFBD) in Chinese firms is relatively small compared with the male. In other words, the boards members are predominantly male. The fixed effects model indicates that both the number and proportion of female directors are significant in influencing CSR performance. Surprisingly, we note that the average age of female board directors has a significant and negative impact on CSR performance. The results also indicate that the education level of the female director does play a significant role in CSR performance. This demonstrates that firms need to recruit educated board directors and with a right mix of age.",

The study employs OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity.Findings: The study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. We do not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment.Originality/value: The study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair\u2019s role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policy-makers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.",

In contrast, the novel approach introduced in this study constructs a topographical map demarcating the relative importance, dispersion, and interrelationship among many finance topics. The final product is a bird\u2019s eye view of the whole literature illustrating historical trends, concentrations, and territories. We apply qualitative analysis, purposive sampling, and syntactic analysis to 34,261 articles published in 52 journals over the past two decades. First, we analyze the proliferation and historical development of topics. We find that a few topics (e.g., insurance) are losing ground to newer ones (e.g., blockchain and digital currency). However, several topics seem to occupy a stable, sizeable portion of finance literature (e.g., investment strategies and portfolio management). Next, we analyze the relationship between topics and journals and report strong tendencies that are not always confined by the traditional scope of journals. For instance, papers addressing investment strategy and portfolio management issues seem to appear in numerous journals; while special topics such as blockchain, digital currencies, dividends, and real estate can only be found in a limited number of journals. We also report strong interdependence among topics. More than a third of the papers screened in this study discuss two topics or more. We identify a list of topics that are likely to be investigated jointly. Overall, our work demonstrates the historical evolution of the entire finance literature; and identifies fertile areas for future research.",

We investigate contagion effects in individual stock markets and from a regional perspective using dynamic conditional correlations during the global financial crisis, European debt crisis, Brexit, and COVID-19. The empirical evidence confirms contagion effects in some individual markets. However, significant evidence of contagion is found only during the global financial crisis from the regional perspective.

        "abstract": "Although theory suggests that financial market imperfections\u2013mainly information asymmetries, market segmentation and transaction costs\u2013prevent poor people from escaping poverty by limiting their access to formal financial services, new financial technologies (FinTech) are seen as key enablers of financial inclusion. Indeed, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-2030-ASD) and the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion (G20-HLP-DFI) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality. This paper investigates the interrelationship between FinTech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the Global Findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI. Highlights Harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality has been proposed by the UN and G20.

The representation of female corporate leaders increases the likelihood of fraud detection, thus reducing firms\u2019 propensity to engage in fraud. The finding confirms that women are risk averse and more committed to ethical practices than men in corporate leadership positions. Moreover, this impact of gender diversity is contingent upon the nature of ultimate controllers of listed companies: more female representation in top leadership roles can mitigate fraud commission or detect fraud effectively in non-state-owned enterprises, but not in state-owned enterprises. In addition, the recent anti-corruption campaign initiated by Chinese President Jinping Xi is a powerful form of public governance.

In the first, we track the relevance of monetary policy decisions originating in developed economies for interbank funding liquidity risk in BRICS economies during crisis periods by applying a time-varying parameter model in a Bayesian framework.

In contrast, the Federal Reserve's National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) \u2014 a representative of the health of both real and financial sectors in the US \u2014 matters more. The temporal patterns of the results imply that key central banking decisions precede or coincide with low degrees of associations. In the second, we examine whether interbank credit crunch exerts an influence on market liquidity risk in BRICS economies using a Granger causality approach. The results reveal that interbank credit crunch depresses market liquidity in the corresponding domestic market and that the state of fear and credit market conditions in the US exert some influence in this regard. Overall, our findings hint at judicious market intervention and liquidity management by BRICS central banks.",

        "abstract": "Prior research suggests that the presence of high quality auditors (i.e. proxied by audit firm characteristics) constrains accrual-based earnings management, but it inadvertently leads to higher real activities manipulation. We investigate whether such trade-off exists between accrual-based and real earnings management activities in the presence of female or male auditors. We use a sample of UK firms for the period 2009 to 2016 and find that firms audited by female auditors do not resort to a higher level real activities manipulation when their ability to engage in accruals management is constrained. Overall, our results suggest that the benefits of hiring female auditors (i.e. less accrual-based earnings management) are overwhelmingly higher than the costs they might bring to the client firms (i.e. higher real activities manipulation).",

        "publication title": "Kuala Lumpur - from a tin mining settlement to a neoliberal stronghold of Southeast Asia",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Kuala Lumpur (KL) emerged as the capital of the newly independent Federation of Malayan States in 1957 with a population of 316,000. Over the next 60 years, the city expanded into a major urban regional conurbation. It now covers an area of 2,790\u00a0km\n              2 and has a population of around 7.7 million. In the last two\u00a0decades, market-driven, fast-track development, underpinned by road infrastructure has accelerated the city's urban transformation. Especially over the last two\u00a0decades, a spate of urban redevelopments, including commercial and retail complexes, specialised centres, industrial parks, educational complexes and residential estates have transformed the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Region (KLMR) beyond recognition. KL is only one example among many of intensive Southeast Asian property-led urban development, fuelled by demographic pressures and global capital inflows that transformed the regional natural and built environments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of globalisation, neoliberalism and property-led development, on the built form and socio-cultural legacies of the KLMR. Design/methodology/approach: The major aim of this study is to determine how neoliberalism and property-led development have impacted the urban form and structure of the KLMR. The methodology applied in this study concentrates mainly on the use of qualitative research methods. The major qualitative research methods include qualitative analysis, field surveys and observations, primary and secondary data collection. The approach in this study is to exemplify the shift from government-sponsored development in the post-independence period to the current globalised-private oriented development. Findings: The major findings of this research suggest that the global, property-led mode of urban development, whilst superficially successful, undermined traditional and tropical-climate urban landscapes. It also bequeathed many urban or property level problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, planning governance and building management issues. The paper outlines narratives for a more balanced and sustainable mode of urban development, which is more in tune with local culture and climatic conditions. Originality/value: This paper provides a deep insight analysis and evaluation of KL's growth from a small town into a global metropolitan region where property-led development dictates the rules and determines the character of the city.\n            ",

Board effectiveness, student engagement, audit quality, Vice-Chancellors (VC) pay, and VC gender are targeted for analysis.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This study is based on content analysis. We used the EU NFR Directive (2014/95/EU) to measure NFR. This includes environmental, corporate social responsibility, human rights, corporate board effectiveness, and corruption and bribery. Cross sectional data was collected form 89 HEIs worldwide across 15 different countries over three years. Content analysis, the weighted scoring method and panel data analysis are employed to obtain the results.Findings \u2013 Through a neo-institutional theoretical lens, this study provides a broader understanding of NFR content disclosure practices within HEIs. Our findings reveal that the audit quality, VC pay, and VC gender are significantly and positively associated with NFR content disclosure. However, board effectiveness has a significant negative impact on NFR content disclosure. More interestingly, our findings reveal that student engagement has an insignificant association with NFR content disclosure and there significant difference on the level of NFR content disclosure across universities situated in different geographical region such as USA, Australia, UK, and EU, Asia & Canada. Our findings have important implications for regulators and policymakers. Our evidence appears to be robust when controlling for possible endogeneities.Originality/value \u2013 The study contributes to the literature on corporate non-financial disclosure as it provides new insights of corporate governance mechanism and NFR disclosure within HEIs.",

        "abstract": "he extinction and biodiversity accounting literature focused initially on developed economies including the UK and Europe, spreading recently to research on Africa, especially South Africa, China and other countries in the Far East. The Middle East, however, has not received attention in the academic literature. Furthermore, there seems to be less information readily available on species extinction and biodiversity degradation in Middle Eastern countries. In this chapter, we address species extinctions in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Libya to provide insights into the situation in these countries, problems and issues arising, as well as potential solutions. The authors present the causes of species extinctions in the Middle East as well as provide information on some of the initiatives underway to prevent extinctions. Whilst most of this book focuses on motivations for species protection grounded in financial materiality, accountability, legitimacy and ethics, this chapter builds a religious rationale, indeed imperative, for species protection and biodiversity conservation. Part I of this chapter discusses the status of threatened species in Saudi Arabia, providing an understanding of the importance of religion as a rationale for species protection. In Part II, the status of threatened species in Jordan is discussed. Part III provides detailed interview evidence on the deterioration of biodiversity in Libya and for enhanced species protection.evidence on the deterioration of biodiversity in Libya and the need for enhancedspecies protection.",

The analysis is conducted using a sample of non-financial firms listed in eleven European countries between 2006 and 2017. We find a positive association between non-executive employee ownership and financial reporting quality. Furthermore, we find this positive association to be more pronounced for firms operating in the following settings: higher labour union density, more industry peer firms and more flexible labour market regulations. Overall, these findings support the view that employee shareholding enhances the quality of financial reporting by aligning the interests of employees with those of shareholders through two channels: reduced agency problems and enhanced employee retention. Our study contributes to the research on the impact of ownership characteristics on financial reporting incentives. It underscores the role non-executive employee ownership can play in improving a firm\u2019s corporate governance and therefore the quality of financial reporting.",

We show that target firms listed both in the secondary market of the UK, known as the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), and in the traditionally regulated Main Market, experience significant abnormal stock returns prior to takeover announcements. These results persist after controlling for market anticipation, indicating signs of information leakage. Contrary to the narrative that secondary markets may be more susceptible to market abusive behaviors, we find that the AIM targets experience significantly lower pre-announcement returns. In addition, we do not find support that the introduction of stricter laws reduces the price run-ups in any of the two markets. In sharp contrast, we find support that the enforcement of insider trading laws, through criminal convictions, reduces the pre-announcement abnormal stock returns but only in the market in which the enforcement focuses.",

Design/methodology/approach: This study adds to institutional management accounting research using a multi-level perspective of institutional dynamics in the smart city context. Data were collected from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SOE that was under socio-political sustainability pressures to implement a smart electricity network project in New Minya city. Findings: Smart city projects have formed social and political sustainability pressures, which introduced the enterprise resource planning (ERP) network as a new management accounting system. A new (complex and multi-level) management accounting system was invented to reinvent the sustainable city as an \u201caccounting city\u201d (which appeared rhetorically as a \u201csmart city\u201d). \u201cSmart\u201d being the visibility and measurability of the sustainability performance of the collective body, which calls the city and its connectivity to different institutional levels brought out in a city network project for the ERP-enabled electricity distribution. Research limitations/implications: This study examines a single case study from a single smart city and identifies the accounting community\u2019s need for multiple and comparative case studies to further analyse the potential impact of smart city reforms and projects on the sustainable implementation of management accounting systems. Practical implications: City policymakers and managers may benefit from the practical findings of this interpretive field-based case study in planning, implementing and monitoring smart city projects and objectives. Social implications: Individual and collective well-being may be enhanced through new management accounting forms of multi-level local governance and increased political, field and organisational sustainability. Originality/value: This study provides important insights into the sustainability dynamics of management accounting in achieving smart city reforms. The achievement of sustainability management accounting systems has connected to multiple ERP roles at different institutional levels, which resulted in accommodating the socio-political objectives of smart city projects.",

In addition to the stimulus packages to adjust the economic shock from COVID-19, regulators around the world are searching for innovative mechanisms to rebuild the economy. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of SRI Sukuk to serve as an Islamic social finance solution for development projects to mitigate the adverse economic effects of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed-method research framework. The authors use a systematic literature review following the recommendations of Bowen (2009) to identify critical challenges financing PPP projects using SRI Sukuk. In the next phase, the authors interview participants involved in an SRI Sukuk financed PPP project to get more significant insights on the challenges identified through the literature review process. Findings: The authors identify the need for greater transparency for SRI financed PPP projects. Also, organisational and legislative challenges are limiting the attractiveness of SRI Sukuk as a financing mechanisms for post-COVID development projects. Practical implications: SRI Sukuk is an emerging financing concept, and the use of such an Islamic financial instrument in financing development projects can serve as a viable alternative for policymakers in a post-COVID economic environment.

        "publication title": "Special Issue-Sustainable Accounting Reporting: Proposal ",
        "abstract": "Currently, the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is fragmented.  Yet, if the world is to tackle climate and pollution crises, it needs to urgently transition away from fossil fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones.  This transformative journey will involve accounting reforms to enrich stakeholder information re the environmental impact of an organisation\u2019s activities.  The special issue hosts papers that bridge environmental and accounting disciplines that analyzes and reflects on entity sustainability performance reporting.  There are opposing views on SAR reform pathways.  Experts dispute the notion of \u2018materiality\u2019 or significant reporting impacts.  Anglo-Saxon accounting bodies tend to be traditional and investor-minded.  They advocate for a single financial materiality focus and prudent, incremental reporting system reform.  Global and European institutions (UN, EU, GRI) seek to broaden materiality beyond financial impacts.  Their alternative \u2018double materiality\u2019 preference considers a broader spectrum of stakeholders compared to traditional, conventional accounting and reporting systems.  Both the traditional single and broader double accounting reform perspectives have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages.  Although the standard setting landscape is evolving, division, paradox and contention remain.  Notwithstanding sustainability accounting and reporting contention, climatic and ecological challenges impel urgent resolution.Anthropogenic and industrial pressures accelerate emission-intensive construction activity, responsible for 38% of global energy-related CO2 emissions.  Within decades, climate change could dent global GDP by 11\u201314%.  Within the next seventy years, sea levels are likely to rise by 1m.  In a worst-case scenario, if all of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet were to melt or other tipping points reached, the rise could be as much as 7m.  Worryingly, the seemingly inexorable increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations intimates we are drifting towards such a doomsday scenario.  Whilst in the 1970s, the annual increase in this GHG was 1 ppm; it now exceeds 2.4 ppm per year.  Conventional economic and accounting performance metrics, because they tend to ignore either environmental or social considerations, may be necessary but are insufficient entity or project performance indicators.  They simply ignore the external costs of many construction, industrial or agricultural activities.  Notable external costs include ecosystem depletion or habitat loss, plastic contamination, air and water pollution.  Since the 1950\u2019s, the annual world output of plastic has increased almost 200 times from 2 to over 380 million tonnes of which 8-12 million tonnes is washed into the sea (2-3%).  The mismanaged disposal of plastic waste, mainly from lower income countries with weak disposal infrastructure (notably India, Bangladesh and the Philippines), causes marine plastic pollution that threatens the safety of global fish stocks.  The climate crisis, contamination and pollution impel urgent accounting systems reform.The special issue critically assesses the state of sustainability accounting and reporting today across a range of sectors.  It disseminates research that influences policy and practice for a green economic transition.  We particularly welcome international, cross-disciplinary articles on business sustainability that integrate financial with environmental considerations, involving:\u2022\tGreen investment evaluation\u2022\tMeasuring climate change mitigation impacts\u2022\tIntegrated variance analysis for environmental improvement\u2022\tReporting on performance improvement in, for example, energy mix, air pollution, toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes\u2022\tAssessing ecosystems impacts (e.g. water pollution, biodiversity)\u2022\tEvaluating land use impacts \u2022\tAssessing community health-related impacts of firm practices or outputs\u2022\tEvaluation of unsustainable production or consumptionSuggest themes:\u2022\tMulti-criteria project evaluations\u2022\tSustainable performance management\u2022\tSustainable cost and full-cost accounting\u2022\tTriple bottom line (TBL) accounting\u2022\tNatural capital inventory accounting\u2022\tGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI)\u2022\tMateriality and precautionary principle\u2022\tRisk assessment, green investment due diligence and assessmentIn this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome.

In this model, trade is driven, not by comparative advantages, but by strategic considerations. We prove, in a Ricardianframework, the simultaneous existence of two types of equilibria, at both of which active international trade takes place. In the first type of equilibrium, both countries specialise based on comparative advantages. In the other, each country produces only its comparative-disadvantage good. The welfare properties, and policy implications of this result (using the examples of the China\u2013US trade war and Venezuela), are discussed at length in two dedicated sections. We show that the predictions of the RTCA depend, not on the number of agents in the economy, but on the nature of agents: the RTCA fails to obtain even with an infinite number of large players in each country. We prove that the RTCA prevails when agents are price-takers, and establish the conditions under which equilibria of our market game coincide with Walrasian ones.",

        "abstract": "Every year the global financial system sends trillions of dollars to finance environmental destruction, but the climate crisis forces change.  Notwithstanding vested interests and the unrecognised paradox of adopting environmental business strategies, the implementation of sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is imperative to catalyse economic transition away from fossil-fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones.  The research proceeded sequentially.  First, it scanned the backdrop to the SAR problem and identified key associated institutions and a corpus of recent literature.  An initial review to disentangle its conflicting threads generated three themes of \u2018climate crisis\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 or more \u2018radical\u2019 SAR reform paradigms.  Iteratively harnessing this thematic lens, the investigation re-examined the SAR literature corpus.  It detected fragmented SAR responses to the climate crisis.  Accordingly, the research reformulated its first theme to \u2018dystopic climate crisis fragmentation\u2019 but only refined the other two conservative or radical themes to take account of materiality and the split between Anglo-Saxon (IFRS, SSAB) or global and continental institutions (UN, EU, GRI).  Conservatives defend incremental standard improvements but retain a single materiality investor-focus.  Radicals seek to implement double materiality with a broader spectrum of stakeholders in mind.  Both approaches have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages, so the SAR contention rumbles on.  Whilst the standard setting landscape is evolving, division, paradox and contention remain.  Given vested interests in the destructive status quo, it would be na\u00efve to expect a harmonious SAR Ithaca to emerge anytime soon.  Yet the challenges impel urgent action.",

The results, however, exhibit no significant impact of banks' environmental performance on market performance. Moreover, conventional banks have better environmental performance than their Islamic counterparts. Our results are consistent across different estimation techniques after controlling for endogeneity issues. The findings of the study are novel and offer important policy implications for management, regulatory authority, and environmental activists.",

        "abstract": "There are large primary literatures that evaluate the effectiveness of either R&D tax credits or R&D subsidies in promoting private R&D. However, this Meta-Regression Analysis, by investigating these literatures jointly, is the first study that systematically measures and compares the effectiveness of these two policy instruments. After controlling for publication selection and sources of heterogeneity, we find that both tax credits and subsidies induce additional private R&D and that neither instrument systematically outperforms the other. However, whereas subsidy effects are increasing over time tax credit effects are not. Although their respective effects are \u201csmall\u201d, they are not negligible: in round terms, an additional $1 of public R&D support of either type induces 7.5 cents of additional private R&D expenditure. Sources of heterogeneity in the reported effects include: tax credits are most effectively delivered as \u201cincremental\u201d schemes, are more effective in economies with a balanced \u201cpolicy-mix\u201d regime, and are generally less effective for micro firms and SMEs than for large firms; while subsidies are more effective for manufacturing firms, although not for high-tech firms, and are more effective than tax credits in economies predominantly using subsidies. Finally, we argue for the importance of statistical power in the design of evaluation studies.",

        "abstract": "Research Question/IssueWe examine the role of corporate executives in dividend tunneling activity by controlling shareholders and whether the correlation between executive ownership and dividend tunneling is influenced by internal and external governance mechanisms.Research Findings/InsightsWe find increased executive ownership may lead to a higher level of dividend tunneling. This is further strengthened by our finding that the positive effect of executive ownership on dividend tunneling is more pronounced for firms with weaker minority shareholder protection. In addition, our results show that higher degrees of state ownership may further intensify this positive association. Finally, we find that analyst coverage has a moderating effect and constrains the collusion between controlling shareholders and executives in dividend tunneling activity.Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur study contributes to the literature on the role of managerial ownership in controlling shareholders' dividend tunneling activity. We fill a gap in the literature on the corporate agency problem by providing evidence that dividends have been employed by controlling shareholders as a means of tunneling and that executives with higher ownership are more likely to collude with controlling shareholders in dividend tunneling activities.Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsThis study contributes to the debates around the promotion of the cash dividend policy in China, as our findings show that cash dividends are used as a tunneling vehicle. Providing important evidence to regulators, our findings support the argument that external monitoring by financial analysts can effectively constrain dividend tunneling by dominant shareholders, especially in the context of emerging stock markets with high ownership concentration, weak minority shareholder protection, and an underdeveloped legal system.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we examine the relationship between inbound tourism and exports in Singapore. We address whether there is a long-run relationship between exports and tourism and the direction of causality between these two variables. Our findings suggest a long-run relation between Singapore\u2019s exports and inbound tourism and that the causation is bidirectional. This implies that inbound tourism in Singapore results in a higher demand for its domestic products. This increased demand for Singaporean products, in turn, acting as a positive advertising campaign in favor of Singapore, promotes inbound tourism to this country. The policy implication of these findings is twofold. First, inbound tourism in Singapore not only contributes directly to GDP, employment, and the current account via tourism revenues but also by stimulating exports it improves further the current account of Singapore. Secondly, the stimulation of exports induced by inbound tourism creates favorable sustainability conditions for the entire tourism sector. However, one should be cautious that this effect is taking more than 9 months to materialize and that inbound tourism may initially have a negative impact effect on Singapore\u2019s exports as the overtime effect of tourism on exports exhibits a J-curve behavior.",

However, a framework that depicts the association between credit creation, financial innovation and endogenous creation of boom-bust cycles is less evident and the gap between empirical research and theoretical development remains. Hence, this study represents a first attempt to provide a framework that could explain the switch of economic cycles from virtuous to unvirtuous and vice versa. We examine the role of financial innovation and identify its \u201chidden soul\u201d defined as the rate of financial innovation (RoFIN). We study RoFIN together with other structural factors, such as monopolistic financial power concentration and financial deregulation in the creation of what we identify as the wealth trap, as a potential mediating factor behind the creation of virtuous and unvirtuous cycles. A cross-country statistical exercise using the VUC indicator on the United States, United Kingdom, and Euro area economies shows the exponential effect of the rate of financial innovation over time and provides indicative evidence in support of our framework. Finally, we report that the indicator is better able to identify the unvirtuous cycle stages than the traditionally used Credit-to-GDP ratio.",

        "abstract": "The global interest in sukuk, an Islamic alternative to bond financing, has grown rapidly, particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, due to its distinctive features and investment quality. Sukuk were first launched in Malaysia and are presently available in 29 countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Despite the global market prevalence of sukuk, asset pricing literature has not yet addressed the pricing mechanism of sukuk, which is inherently different from bonds and equity due to the contractual differences. However, analysts use LIBOR, or the Islamic interbank benchmark rate, as the ad\u2010hoc benchmark to evaluate sukuk performance. In this study, we develop a basic pricing model that captures the common risks in sukuk returns. We identify two risk factors for sukuk that require risk premiums: (a) sukuk market risk and (b) information asymmetry risk. Using these two common sukuk risks factors, investment analysts can estimate the fair value of sukuk more precisely than other ad hoc measures available.",

        "publication title": "A Historical Institutionalist Perspective on the Persistence of State Controls during Financial Sector Reforms: The Insightful Case of Myanmar",
        "abstract": "Purpose: Many transition economies are former socialist planned economies and have undergone market reforms of their financial sector to signal their transition towards democracy. However, governments in these countries have been reluctant to relinquish the pre-existing controls on economy and have adopted nuanced and sophisticated approaches to retain control. In such context, scholars may find it challenging to investigate the role played by the state in the success or failure of attempted market reforms. This work investigates the different forms of state-induced accounting controls that may preserve the status quo within the economy during transition, using Myanmar as an example. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a longitudinal qualitative research method aiming to reveal the very processes and mechanisms used by the banks and their evolution over time. This method is in accordance with the historical institutionalist perspective that they have applied within this research. Findings: The authors found that the Myanmar government embarked on the privatisation of their financial sector from 1990 to 2016 as a major public sector reform initiative. Under the guise of market reforms, it used both state-led and market-led controls to emulate and retain the socialist banking model where banks are used to fund the immediate government's budget deficits. This created a series of intended and unintended consequences, resulting in the ultimate failure of the government's market reforms. Research limitations/implications: Previously, research on public sector management accounting in emerging economies was not relying consistently on using theory. The relative limited theorisation led to gaps when attempting to understand and explain the opaque forms of state control mechanisms in transition economies. By applying historical institutionalist perspective, and a more theory-driven, reflective approach to the interpretation of the data collected, the authors have provided a deeper insight and understanding on how different forms of state controls can emerge, adapt and persist in transition economies such as Myanmar. Practical implications: The authors demonstrated that though the state may have implemented market reforms to signal regimes change, this does not necessarily mean that the government has relinquished their control on the economy. The state could take a more sophisticated, covert approach towards state controls leading to both intended and unintended consequences. Thus, even if the state's preferences change, the decisions cannot be easily reversed, as path-dependent state controls may have become pervasive affecting any further institutional and policy developments. Thus, the authors suggest that governments in both transition and developed economies should be cautious when enacting regulations on corporate control. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors have applied a historical institutional perspective in their analysis instead of the more widely used sociological, institutionalist approach. This allowed authors to harness rich longitudinal data indicating that market reforms and their success or failure should be examined as an ongoing process rather than a completed action. This is especially important in transition economies where the state may be unwilling to renounce the existing controls on the industry and may resort to more opaque forms of state control, eventually obstructing the intended reforms.",

Monthly contributions to pension accounts are explored on the basis of socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the customers of a currently operating pension company. Findings reveal that differences in people\u2019s saving capacities have become a source for pension inequality. Furthermore, state subsidies, which increase in proportion to individual contributions, strengthen unequal distributional dynamics.

Using one of the largest bank-level datasets collected from 12 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries over the 2006-2013 period to-date, our findings are as follows. First, we find that risk disclosures have a predictive effect on BCRs. Second, we find that the relationship between risk disclosures and BCRs is contingent on the quality of governance structures. Specifically, we find that the informativeness of risk disclosures on BCRs is higher in banks with larger board size, greater independence, higher government ownership, and better Shariah supervisory board, but lower in banks with greater block ownership, higher foreign ownership and the presence of CEO duality. The central tenor of our findings remains unchanged after controlling for a number of firm- and country-level factors, alternative risk disclosure measures, firm- and national-level governance proxies, different types of banks, and potential endogeneities.

        "abstract": "Banking stability is essential to any economy due to its many functions, including intermediation, payment facilitation, and credit creation. Thus, the stability of the banking industry is one of the critical ingredients in economic growth. This paper analyzes how bank capital, credit and liquidity requirements impact bank solvency, using ten major banks controlling 90% of the UK market share in 2009-2018. The GMM model indicates a strong association between credit and liquidity risks. That is, when banks finance a risky or distressed project, this will lead to an increase in nonperforming loans (NPL), which reduces bank liquidity. Poor liquidity profile of a bank may restrict its ability to act as a financial intermediary. In addition, the findings indicate that efficiency, asset quality, and economic growth have a significant positive effect on the solvency of banks. The results also show that the regulatory capital (Tier1) has a positive significant influence on bank solvency. Further, the results indicate that during the economic boom, banks tend to increase their regulatory capital. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that during the \"good time\", banks can accumulate enough capital that is genuinely capable of absorbing negative shock. Also, it is important for banks to ensure that they are efficient but also have a robust credit appraisal system to reduce NPL. This paper also demonstrates the implications of increased capital requirements. That is, increased capital requirements ensure not only banks are liquid but also solvent, which allows them to provide financial intermediation.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper furthers research into the potential contribution of pollutant databases for corporate accountability. We evaluate the quality of corporate and government mercury reporting via the Australian National Pollutant Inventory (NPI), which underpins Australia's reporting under the Minamata Convention, a global agreement to reduce mercury pollution. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative characteristics of accounting information are used as a theoretical frame to analyse ten interviews with thirteen interviewees as well as 54 submissions to the 2018 governmental enquiry into the NPI. Findings: While Australian mercury accounting using the NPI is likely sufficient to meet the expected Minamata reporting requirements (especially in comparison to developing countries), we find significant limitations in relation to comparability, accuracy, timeliness and completeness. These limitations primarily relate to government (as opposed to industry) deficiencies, caused by insufficient funding. The findings suggest that multiple factors are required to realise the potential of pollutant databases for corporate accountability, including appropriate rules, ideological commitment and resourcing Practical implications: The provision of additional funding would enable the NPI to be considerably improved (for mercury as well as other pollutants), particularly in relation to the measurement and reporting of emissions from diffuse sources. Originality/value: Whilst there have been prior reviews of the NPI, none have focused on mercury, whilst conversely prior studies which have discussed mercury information have not focused on the NPI. In addition, no prior NPI studies have utilised interviews nor have engaged directly with NPI regulators. There has been little prior engagement with pollutant databases in social and environmental accounting (SEA) research.",

Data for 104 financial and 328 non-financial firms constituting 2591 observations operating in 22 emerging economies were collected from the Datastream database for the period 2011\u20132020. We applied OLS and 2SLS regression techniques to analyze the data. Results show that financial firms emit less carbon than their non-financial counterparts. The results further show that carbon emissions reduce firms\u2019 return on equity, Tobin\u2019s Q, Z-score, and credit rating. Our findings remain robust in different estimation techniques and alternative proxies of performance. Our results have some important policy implications for emerging economies.",

        "publication title": "Corporate adoption of SDG reporting in a non-enabling institutional environment : Insights from Libyan oil industries",
        "abstract": "Drawing on institutional voids, we examine how corporate engagement in sustainable development goals reporting (SDGR) is influenced by Libya\u2019s non-enabling institutional environment post the political change in 2011. Specifically, we examine the impact of national-level SDG performance (NLSP) of 2015 to 2010, as a proxy for the non-enabling institutional environment, on SDGR observed in 2015/2016. This study also explores whether the NLSP-SDGR nexus is contingent on the environmental sensitivity of oil industries in Libya. We employ a quantitative content analysis based on word counts to determine the level of SDGR among a cross- sectional sample of 524 observations of the major Libyan oil companies in the 2015/2016 fiscal year. Using measures derived from the World Development Indicators (WDI), a cross-sectional regression analysis has been employed to investigate how NLSP explains variations in SDGR noted in 2015/2016. Descriptive evidence in- dicates that Libyan oil companies tend to report SDG information on their websites about Good Health and Well- being (SDG3), Quality Education (SDG4), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12). Our regression results suggest that the NLSP positively and significantly influences corporate commitment to the SDGR agenda among a sample of the major oil com- panies in Libya. Additionally, the environmental sensitivity of oil industries appeared to be moderating the NLSP- SDGR nexus. As SDGR tends to be a self-regulation mechanism, our empirical evidence emphasises the impor- tance of establishing effective regulatory agencies to ensure companies\u2019 achievements of their social, environ- mental, and economic responsibilities efficiently and effectively.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Drawing from the firm\u2019s entrepreneurial identity and ecology perspectives, this study aims to explain why the firms deviate from standard corporate governance practices and apply innovative management control. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a panel of 2,538 public companies listed with the New York Stock Exchange to explain the impact of corporate governance deviance on firm\u2019s performance. The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index. Findings: Study unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firm\u2019s performance. Consequently, it can be said that the firms which use innovative governance mechanisms, usually stay ahead of the market by leading the governance trends. The findings also generalise the firm\u2019s entrepreneurial identity and organisational ecology perspectives. Research limitations/implications: Research implies that the firm\u2019s entrepreneurial identity demands innovative managerial control. This study is focused on the US financial market, but in future, researchers could revalidate the deviance index. Scholars can also use mixed methods to test the need for innovative governance mechanisms in emerging markets. Practical implications: The firms should focus on innovative governance practices not only to safeguard the firm\u2019s entrepreneurial identity but also to pursue the growth objectives. Such innovative mechanisms and managerial controls are helpful to deal with industrial transformations to satisfy key stakeholders. Originality/value: The study contributed to governance and management control research by sharing insights and catering the potential endogeneity problem faced to measure corporate governance measures. The study also proposes an alternative testing tool to measure governance deviance to add methodological uniqueness and reduce knowledge gap.",

        "publication title": "Corporate environmental accountability in Nigeria: An example of regulatory failure and regulatory capture",
        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate how state regulations become ineffective in holding corporations accountable for environmental degradation in an emerging economy context, with a specific focus on oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on capture theory to bring out the factors that have rendered redundant the state intervention to make corporations accountable for their environmental activities. The research setting is the oil and gas and cement industry in Nigeria. Data for the study are derived from both documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews and analysed using a thematic technique. Findings: The findings of the paper demonstrate a regulatory failure to hold corporations to account for their environmental activities. A lack of political will, outdated regulations and the manipulation of the regulators, all have played a part in preventing corporations from being accountable for their activities. In addition, the widespread elite corruption in the country has provided corporations with leeway to manipulate their environmental accountability practices. The study emphasises the need for continuous review of the regulations and efforts to reduce corruption in order to promote corporations' environmental accountability in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to Nigeria, oil and gas and cement industries. The theoretical lens can be used to address problem of capture of the regulations and institution in the country. Practical implications: The practical implication is that it would enhance environmental regulations in Nigeria and emerging economies. It will also provide support from researchers emerging markets on the adoption of capture theory in future research. Social implications: It will promote corporate best environmental practices in the country. It will reduce the issues surrounding environmental accountability practices and create awareness on environmental issues among the populace. It will create the impression that corporations will be held accountable for their environmental activities in the country and the need to have improved environmental regulations in the country. Originality/value: The study adds to the debate on corporate environmental accountability practices engendering insights from the Nigerian oil and gas and cement industry. The paper demonstrates how companies in emerging economies can capture state regulations and how rendering environmental accountability becomes more of rhetoric than a reality with little impacts on the welfare of people and society.",

By including a sample of 159 firms listed on three Asian stock markets from 2013 to 2017, this study found that the effects of corporate governance mechanisms vary significantly among the three Asian markets. Specifically, this study shows that board size has positively influenced listed firms' financial performance in the Singapore Exchange. However, our findings show that board size has negatively affected listed firms' financial performance in Thailand's Stock Exchange. In addition, our results reveal that board independence has negatively influenced listed firms' financial performance in Bursa Malaysia. Finally, this study provides implications for regulatory authorities in the Asian stock markets to separate between chairman and CEO roles since most Asian firms are owned and directed by business families.",

We propose a semi-latent specification of an endogenous control variable, which can, for the first time, explicitly identify, for each individual firm, the threshold level where the marginal impact of CSR on CFP turns positive. We provide empirical evidence that this threshold depends on the additional dimension and consequently, the previously reported U-shape seems to be an aggregation of relationships of differential magnitude and direction. This disaggregation fits the data better and therefore, we maintain that the addition of a higher dimension, along with the identification of the threshold level, can explain the conflicting results in the literature.",

We have used various databases, including Bankscope, World Bank, and Transparency International, to gather Bank-specific and macro-economic data for 77 banks covering the period 2005\u20132014. We perform ordinary least square (OLS) and generalised methods of moments regression (GMM) using a balanced panel and find (1) Islamic banks as less efficient and stable as compared to conventional banks in the GCC region, (2) corruption has a negative (positive) impact on Islamic (conventional) banks' stability. Our findings provide support for the \u2018sand the wheel\u2019 hypothesis of corruption for Islamic banks.

        "abstract": "This research reviews and analyzes prior corporate social responsibility (CSR) studies centered on its implications and disclosure in higher education institutions (HEIs). Nine major databases were analyzed to review research articles from various business, management, higher education, and accounting journals for the period of 2004\u20132020. We follow the seven-step systematic review guidelines developed by Fink 2019 and we base our review analysis on fifty-eight journal articles. The systematic literature review results show a significant increase in the number of CSR article publications and the extent and trend of disclosure. The majority of prior research was based on questionnaires to evaluate the HEIs curriculum and focus on the CSR implication process. However, HEIs are still lagging behind in CSR implication and disclosure, and with a long way to go to obtain sustainability goals. From the study, several opportunities for future research emerged. This study can be useful for HEIs policymakers and practitioners to access the usefulness of CSR implications and disclosures in HEIs. In addition, this analysis assists scholars to explore in-depth the uncovered points related to CSR in HEIs context. This is the first systematic review of CSR implications and disclosures that comprehensively covers higher education institutions as a sector and presents a reference for academic literature from 2004 to 2020.",

Given that the relationship between audit committee (AC) and engagement partner (EP) involves extensive interactions and information sharing with the aim to protect the integrity of financial statements, this study examines whether the co-tenure relationship between the person who leads the AC (audit committee chair (ACC)) and EP affects audit outcomes. Using 234 UK non-financial companies, we find that longer co-tenure between ACC and EP improves accruals quality and reduces the propensity to meet or beat the earnings benchmark. Moreover, we do not find a significant relationship between ACC\u2013EP shared tenure and audit fees, alleviating the concern that ACC\u2013EP shared tenure could lead to collusion or inappropriate favoritism towards the EP regarding audit fees.

The EBA addresses model uncertainty in identifying robust determinant(s) of cross\u2010sectional return predictability. Additionally, the paper develops two profitable trading strategies based on return predictability evidence. The result reveals that among the 13 determinants of the cross\u2010sectional variation of return predictability, only value of stock traded (a measure of liquidity) is found to have robust explanatory power by Leamer's (1985) EBA. However, Sala\u2010i\u2010Martin's (1997) EBA reports that value of stock traded, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, level of information and communication technology (ICT) development, governance quality, and corruption perception are robust determinants. We further find that a strategy of buying (selling) aggregate market portfolios of the countries with the highest positive (negative) return predictability statistic in the past 24 months generates statistically significant positive returns in the subsequent 3 to 12 months. In the individual country level, a trading rule of buying (selling) the respective country's aggregate market portfolio, when the return predictability statistic turns out positive (negative), outperforms the conventional buy\u2010and\u2010hold strategy for many countries.",

        "abstract": "Using legitimacy and institutional theories, this study investigates whether lending institutions reward firms in 15 EU countries for their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and disclosure in terms of lowering their cost of debt capital. Our study distinguishes between ESG performance that is used to indicate an effective commitment to ESG strategies, and ESG disclosure that represents an effort to construct an image of commitment designed to positively influence stakeholders\u2019 perceptions. Supporting a version of legitimacy theory, we find that lending institutions value both ESG performance and disclosure and integrate ESG information in their credit decisions \u2013 in that firms with stronger ESG performance have a lower cost of debt, and ESG disclosure has an equal impact on the cost of debt as ESG performance. Although these findings suggest that the market (in context) can engender more desirable social outcomes by rewarding ESG practices, it fails to distinguish between ESG performance and disclosure (which may be contrasted as the more substantive and the more symbolic). Moreover, our results also reflect upon the importance of the role that civil society and the state play in addressing and exploring the limitations of free-market regimes. Specifically, we provide evidence that the impact of ESG performance and disclosure on the cost of debt is more dominant in the stakeholder-oriented countries (where the community is more prevalent). Our main findings are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests, including an alternative measure of the cost of debt, model specifications, and different approaches to address endogeneity. We acknowledge limitations in our research method but point nevertheless to its value in supporting a critical perspective and make suggestions for future research.",

We find that after a decision has been made to pay for the M&A using cash, a large acquirer with growth opportunities and single controlling shareholder use internally generated funds relative to debt financing. An overvalued acquirer with huge cash reserves prefers to use debt financing. Relative to stock financing, a large acquirer with growth opportunities acquiring large targets prefers to use internally generated funds while a mature acquirer with huge cash reserves prefers stock financing relative to cash financing. We also find that markets react differently to various sources of financing acquisitions upon announcements. For pure cash transactions, stock financing has the highest returns and debt financing second with cash recording the lowest returns. The study demonstrates that the source of cash plays a significant role in influencing corporate managers financing decisions and market perceptions.",

        "abstract": "Among the hot research topics, Fintech is leading the trend in terms of the newest technology applications. The relatively new emerging paradigms in various sciences, such as geometry (fractals), physics (quantum), and database systems (distributed ledger\u2014blockchain), seem to potentially contribute to a greater shift in the framework of the finance industry, bringing also some concerns (cyber-threats). Consistent and extensive investigation of the reasonable potential impact of these new models (and their underlying technologies) is performed, and then tested through a SWOT analysis, as the main objective of this research. Threats and opportunities are always intrinsically driven by the introduction of technological advancements (revolutions). This research confirms that information availability and the increasing interconnection of crosswise applications of each discovery to the different fields of science is determining the rapid succession of revolutions identified by evident large shifts in economic paradigms. The growing computing capacity and the development of increasingly powerful predictive software are leading to a competitive, extremely dynamic, and challenging system. In this context, as shown by history, there is a high possibility of market concentration in which, however, only a few corporations\u2014digital giants\u2014can afford to develop these technologies, consolidating their dominance.",

We examine whether Scandinavian firms maintain an optimal level of cash holdings and determine if the active cash holdings management is associated with the firms\u2019 higher SOA and lower adjustment costs. Our findings substantiate that a higher level of off-target cost induces professional managers to rebalance their cash level towards the optimal balance of cash holdings. Our results reveal that Scandinavian firms accelerate SOA towards cash targets primarily for the precautionary motive. Moreover, our results show that SOA is heterogeneous across Scandinavian firms based on adjustment cost and deviate cash holdings towards the target mainly with the support of internal financing. Furthermore, our empirical findings show that the SOA of Norwegian firms is significantly higher than the Danish and Swedish firms.",

        "abstract": "Military mistakes impel strategic reflection. The French Indochina War (FIW) from 1946-1954 furnishes useful insights with some resonance for current challenges. A combination of pre-exiting conditions, catalysts and operational drivers caused the cathartic 1954 French defeat. Pre-conditions included the illegitimacy of the colonial regime, repression that polarised nationalist sentiment. Economically, pernicious terms of trade suppressed industrialisation but oiled speculation until suddenly reversed by devaluation in 1953 that reflected financial disengagement by France but increased American involvement. Vacillating metropolitan and the dubious colonial regime of the \u2018night club\u2019 Emperor, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, fuelled political instability. Militarily, after the disastrous evacuation of the RC4 in 1950, Vi\u1ec7t Minh men and supplies poured across the Chinese frontier. In 1954, financial constraints and the looming international peace conference catalysed Navarre, the new French commander, to gamble on a battle of attrition. He bet that the Vi\u1ec7t Minh would be unable drag artillery to the remote jungle outpost of Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Ph\u00fa, but he underestimated their determination, strength, and adaptability. In early December partisans resented the bungled evacuation of Lai Ch\u00e2u. The entrenched camp\u2019s defences were inadequate and neither infantry sorties nor napalm suppressed VM artillery in the surrounding hills. The French aero-logistical sub-system was overstretched, and significant parachute supplies fell into enemy hands. Navarre scattered his reserves on a futile and remote side show, Operation Atlante. The Americans prevaricated and refused to unleash their B29 fleet. \u2018Iacta alea est\u2019 - the die was cast.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, it assesses existing local accounting and financial reporting practices in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), focusing on the extent to which recent government financial statements published by ten selected countries adhere to mainstream qualitative features of public sector reporting. Second, it investigates the multiple institutional logics at play in the context of government accounting reforms (GARs) in SSA, involving international organisations, epistemic community members, policy makers and local actors. Data for the study are drawn from a content analysis and disclosure scoring of ten SSA government financial statements, supplemented by forty semi-structured interviews carried out in Nigeria and Tanzania. Our findings demonstrate how the generalised assumptive logics of international organisations, coupled with the market and professional logics of epistemic community members and state logics of local politicians, have led to the marginalisation of \u2018good\u2019 existing accounting and financial reporting practice in SSA (as reflected by the extent to which government financial statements adhere to mainstream features of public sector reporting) - while providing the countries with a strong impetus for undertaking a transition towards large-scale GARs involving accrual accounting and IPSASs. The role of the epistemic community in selectively ignoring the positive aspects of local accounting practice is a significant impediment. In this way, members of this epistemic community continue to execute their \u2018relational power\u2019 generated through professional knowledge, expertise and elite connections over the local actors, hence upholding the generalised assumptive logics. The paper argues that public accountability and transparency can be strengthened in SSA countries provided there is an \u2018intelligent\u2019 application of existing regulations and accounting systems, rather than seeking to merely replace them with externally imposed large-scale GARs.",

By using a sample of 59 firms from the top FTSE 100 firms over the period from 2013 to 2018, our findings demonstrated that the lower number of board size and independent directors on the board, the better financial performance of the UKs top FTSE 100 listed firms. However, our study revealed that better financial performance is positively correlated with greater proportion of women on boards. Additionally, we found that board meeting is insignificantly associated with the financial performance of listed firms. This study has important implications for policy makers in the UK to have more women on boards and to decrease board size and the number of independent directors to the optimal size, since there is no one size fits all firms.",

        "abstract": "Corporate financial statements address multiple stakeholders\u2019 needs. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), among others, allow two different classifications, \u201cby function of expense\u201d and \u201cby nature of expense\u201d, for the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income for the period (from now on, also identified in short as \u201cIncome Statement\u201d, or \u201cIS\u201d). XBRL standards ensure compliance and consistency in financial statements\u2019 drafting and filing. XBRL taxonomies reflect the Income Statement IFRS disclosure requirement in the {310000} and {320000} codifications, respectively. Given the recent EU enhanced regulations that proposed extend mandatory ESG reporting to SMEs, this study aims to design and recommend an additional Income Statement to embed structured Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure. A restatement of the IS is organised following an adjusted Value-Added perspective to fit the purpose of sustainability disclosure. The above-mentioned Income Statement should be suitable and adaptable for entities of any size and operating in any industry. This goal can be achieved through customised input weighting. Therefore, this applied research can fill a current financial ESG disclosure gap, ensuring financial statements\u2019 comparability and encouraging additional mandatory disclosures through standardisation. Two more items in the XBRL (IFRS-based) structure are suggested, leading to the introduction of one fully structured statement \u201c{330000}\u2014Statement of comprehensive income, profit or loss, by Added Value, ESG based\u201d and a semi-structured \u201c{814000}\u2014Notes\u2014ESG Ratings and Reporting\u201d to better discuss and disclose the assumptions and results of the ESG Statement.",

The country\u2019s leaders have long attempted to balance the allocation of resources between a strong military and a developing economy in their quest for stability, peace and prosperity. This paper examines and sheds further light on the relationship between Jordan\u2019s military expenditure and its economic growth during the period 1970\u20132015. Using cointegration techniques allowing for structural breaks based on Gregory and Hansen (1996), and the ARDL methodology this paper tests the short\u2013 and long\u2013run equilibrium relationship between military expenditure and economic growth in Jordan. Furthermore, with the error correction model (ECM) and the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests, we examine the stability of the above relationship. The results reveal positive short\u2013 and long\u2013run relationships between military expenditure and economic growth in Jordan, during the period under study. This finding has important policy implication for the Jordanian state, as it justifies the transfer of resources to the military, showing that it has not had a negative impact on economic growth.",

This is to prevent formulating energy related policies on incomplete information resulting from masking the impacts of long-run impacts of different phases of energy price. Hence, this paper explores the asymmetric price responses of industrial energy demand for a panel of 54 sectors across 34 countries over the period 2000\u20132014 using a dynamic hierarchical model. The empirical results from both the regional and sectoral analysis indicate a considerable heterogeneity in the estimated long-run elasticities and preference for using hierarchical model. Further, the estimated elasticities in general indicate that producers are more responsive to price increases than price decreases. In addition, empirical findings reveal that industrial energy demand is characterised by endogenous factors embedded in the asymmetric price effects. From a policy perspective, these findings provide an evidence of marked long-run impacts of energy demand (that are not observable from a traditional symmetric energy consumption pattern) required in formulating dependable energy policies.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study seeks to explore the powerful role(s) of institutionalised performance measurement systems or metrics in smart city governance in a politically and militarily sensitive developing country. Design/methodology/approach: This study extends the application and contribution of a multi-level institutional framework to previous management accounting literature on the potential relationship between performance measurement and smart city governance. The value of utilising a multi-level framework is to broaden and deepen theoretical analyses about this relationship to include the effect of political pressure from the military regime at the macro level on the institutionalisation of a performance measurement system at the micro-organisational level. Taking the New Cairo city council smart electricity networks project (Egypt) as an interpretive qualitative single-case study, data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, direct observations and documentary readings. Findings: Performance measurement systems or metrics, especially in politically and militarily sensitive smart cities, constitutes a process of cascading (macro-micro) institutionalisation that is closely linked to sustainable developments taking place in the wider arena of urban policies. Going a step further, accounting-based performance metrics, arising from political and military pressures towards public-private collaborations, contribute to smart city management and accountability (governance). Institutionalised measurement systems or performance metrics play a powerful accounting role(s) in shaping and reshaping political decisions and military actions in the city council. Originality/value: Theoretically, this study goes beyond the cascading institutionalisation process by arguing for the powerful role(s) of institutionalised accounting and performance measurement systems in smart city decision-making and governance. Empirically, it enriches previous literature with a case study of a developing Arab Spring country, characterised by an emerging economy, political sensitivity and military engagement, rather than developed and more stable countries that have been thoroughly investigated. It is also among the first politically engaged accounting case studies to highlight public-private collaborations as a recent reform in public sector governance and accountability.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the probability of deal success/failure in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) transactions is influenced by a range of deal, firm and country-specific characteristics which tend to affect acquirers\u2019 shareholder returns. The specific hypotheses under investigation relate to the method of payment (cash versus stock), target status (listed versus non-listed), diversification (domestic versus cross-border and industry-wide) and acquirers\u2019 prior bidding experience. Additionally, the authors also investigate whether announced deals reflect an expectation about likelihood of deal completion. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse the probability of deal success/failure in M&As by combining event study and probit regression-based methods. The authors use the standard event study methodology to calculate acquirers\u2019 abnormal returns for up to 10 days before and after the announcement date. In the probit model, the dependent variable is the probability of deal i being failure depending on four sets of explanatory variables: method of payment, target status, diversification and acquirer bidding experience, along with a set of control variables. Findings: The findings from event study confirm that market reaction is indifferent to whether announced deals are likely to be successfully completed or not, consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis. However, the results from cross-sectional, cross-country regressions confirm that the aforementioned deal characteristics, as well as certain firm and country level attributes do influence the likelihood of whether an announced deal is subsequently completed or terminated. Originality/value: In examining whether the specific characteristics affecting the likelihood that M&A transactions, once announced, will ultimately succeed or fail, it seems natural to ask whether the market reaction at the time of deal announcement reflects an expectation regarding deal completion. This could be associated with specific deal or firm-level characteristics influencing shareholder returns or risk, and represents a unique contribution of this study, over and above the use of a global sample of M&A data. The empirical analysis investigates these issues by using an extensive, global sample of 46,758 M&A transactions from 180 countries and 80 industries, which took place between the years 1977 and 2012.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the impact of socio-economic factors on the number of good governance codes and issuers of the first codes at the macro-country level. By covering 3200 observations for 160 countries over 1995\u20132014, this study reports that countries with Anglo-Saxon culture and strong investor protection laws have developed a large number of good governance codes to meet the efficiency needs of legal, political, and cultural values. Moreover, this paper shows that countries with English common law origin alongside civil or religious law have developed a large number of good governance codes. Furthermore, this study indicates that countries with high regulatory quality index have issued a large number of governance codes as a response to the external forces that emerge from coercive associations. However, this study found a positive and significant association between the control of corruption index and the number of governance codes issued by governments to mitigate corruption risk. Additionally, this study reports that countries that issued a large number of good governance codes have gained substantial foreign direct investments inflows and financial aid. This study, therefore, provides meaningful implications for governments and policymakers in countries with weak regulations to issue new governance codes for protecting investors\u2019 rights, thus gain more financial resources.",

        "abstract": "The level of liquidity in banking determines the extent to which a bank can meet its financial intermediation role. Liquidity and regulatory capital requirements have gained momentum after the 2008 global financial crisis. Meeting the shareholder\u2019s need (i.e profitability) and regulatory requirements (liquidity and capital) is a delicate balance that banks strive to achieve. Applying a pooled fixed-effects model on a complete panel of 179 banks from 2008 to 2019 in the European Union, the results show how banks in Europe strive to achieve profitability requirements at the same time meeting the regulatory hurdles. The results indicate, better-capitalised banks lend much more, which in turn enhances profitability. Also, the findings indicate that higher capital requirements for banks significantly positively influence liquidity. Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between growth in loans and total regulatory capital. The results imply banks should ensure that the quality of the capital base and the buffers above the regulatory minimum are built up during periods of strong earnings growth. The results also indicate that profitability is significant in influencing the liquidity of the bank. The results emphasise the need to regulate not only the minimum capital requirement but also the liquidity level.",

        "abstract": "The need for independent audit goes back to the agency theory, the theory of delegation of power and the issue of trust. Stakeholders delegate power to management to manage the business on their behalf, yet they face the risk of information asymmetry and management motivations to commit fraud. The main aim of having an independent auditor was therefore to reduce the risk of information asymmetry and fraudulent behaviour by management. Auditors are required by the International Auditing Standards to detect material fraud and error, and they are expected to have a duty of care for stakeholders. However, recently independent auditors, whether conducting private or public audit, have been scrutinised for failing to detect material fraud. There have been a lot of discussions in the literature about the role of private auditors in detecting fraud, but very little discussions about the role of public auditors in detecting fraud. This chapter will outline the difference between private audit and public audit;explain the legal liability of public auditors in relation to fraud detection; the role of public auditors in detecting fraud; and will critically review the root causes for auditors\u2019 failure to detect fraud.",

        "abstract": "In recent times many corporations have been accused of implementing polices that were discriminative against the female workers. The prominent among these policies was the gender pay differential. The one that came to the public relate to the British Broadcasting organisation [BBC]. This study aims to investigate the impact of stakeholder power on the management decisions at the BBC following the release of its 2017 gender pay gap report.To achieve this objectives, we adopt the qualitative approach, obtaining data (tweets) from social media. This approach enabled us to provide an in-depth understanding of the broken trust as well as the proximity and connectedness of BBC stakeholders who, if not employees, are incidentally TV licence fee payers. This approach also enables an understanding of stakeholder reaction following trust damage actions taken by the BBC. We further analysed the information generated from the tweets thematically which was underpinned by the stakeholders\u2019 theory. We contribute to the body of knowledge with the following key results: (1) stakeholder proximity to gender pay differentials at the BBC was stronger and wider because of their triadic relationship with the corporation e.g. employee, British household and British public. (2) Where there is a strong shareholder proximity, stakeholder trust is quickly eroded by the negative actions of the organisation. (3) Exhibition of stronger stakeholder power forces management to engage in stakeholder trust repair at corporate and individual levels by acting to address their concerns. ",

        "abstract": "A sukuk is an Islamic financial asset structured to offer investors a cash flow equivalent to that of a bond. The difference between them is in their contractual mechanism: a bond constitutes a lender\u2013borrower relationship between the holders and issuers whereas a sukuk constitutes a lessor-lessee, buyer-seller, or a partnership relationship. Therefore, we examine whether they are different assets in terms of their return and risk profile. Given the difference between them, it is also important to identify what drives sukuk returns. The study finds that sukuk returns are insignificantly different from those of bonds but have significantly higher risk. However, we find that sukuk investors are not sufficiently compensated for the higher risk. Overall, our study finds that sukuks\u2019 market performance is unrelated to bond market performance, but the market performance of the industry in which the sukuk-financed project originates has a significant effect on sukuk performance.",

Moreover, the authors used multinomial logistic regressions to extend the results where the dependent variable is a nominal variable equal to (1) for non-payment of dividends, (2) for lower dividend payments, and (3) for higher dividend payments.Findings \u2013 The authors report a finding consistent with the life-cycle theory of dividends where a higher proportion of retained-earnings-to-contributionmix implies a greater likelihood of dividend payments, apart from conventional characteristics such as profitability, size and growth. However, the authors find marked differences in the magnitude and significance of the life-cycle characteristics explaining the likelihood of dividend payouts for Islamic and conventional banks. The authors also find that Islamic banks are smaller and less profitable relative to conventional banks but have higher growth rates, which helps to explain why the proportion of dividend non-payments is higher for Islamic banks than for conventional banks. The results also indicate that the higher default rates and business risk associated with GCC banks reduces their propensity to pay dividends.Practical implications \u2013 The topic of dividends remains an important puzzle in the field of modern finance. The findings have significant implications for a variety of stakeholders in both Islamic and conventional banks in GCC countries, including investors, depositors, analysts, managers, regulators and stock exchanges.Originality/value \u2013 This paper aims to contribute to the literature by drawing on life-cycle theory as a basis for comparing the determinants affecting the likelihood of dividend payouts by Islamic and conventional banks in the GCC countries.",

We develop a theoretical model to analyse how different types of institutions condition the FDI-growth relationship and use various institutional proxies to conduct threshold estimations on panel data for 51 developed and developing countries over the period 1991-2016. Our results consistently reveal a robust, contingent effect of political stability on the FDI-growth nexus, suggesting that, among all the institutional factors considered, the absence of civil conflict or violence in the host economy is most critical in terms of yielding both direct and indirect growth-enhancing benefits associated with technology transfer and spillover effects from FDI inflows. This finding is pertinent to both developed and developing countries, although the threshold level of political stability required to achieve sizeable growth benefits from FDI tends to be lower for developing countries.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to explore the influence of field-level funding pressure and resource dependency on conflicting institutional logics in implementing a new performance measurement system (PMS) within a privatised social enterprise (SE) in a developing country. It answers the research question: how accounting-based key performance indicators (KPIs) were chosen within a privatised SE to maintain co-existence between two different institutional logics, the social and commercial logics, to gain legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Design/methodology/approach: This study expands the application and contribution of the Besharov and Smith\u2019s (2014) logics multiplicity framework to previous management accounting literature on PMS and institutional logics. It adds a new dimension to previous literature to theorise the cognitive dynamics of institutional logics at three distinct but interrelated institutional levels, namely, field, organisational and individual. Data come from an interpretive case study of an Egyptian SE, involved in implementing a social project (drinking water refining) in rural communities. Findings: PMS acts as a political tool through which the privatised case company has gained societal acceptance and legitimacy in the government funding scheme. Its non-political KPIs have turned into political tools to meet the institutional demands of the funding scheme. This government involvement represents field-level institutional logics, which influenced the organisational-level interplay of commercial and social logics and then the individual-level choice of internal KPIs. This contributes to the fact that institutional logics and their interplay between these three levels are \u201cin a state of flux\u201d within SEs\u2019 internal PMS. Originality/value: This study deals with a real-life practical case that proves the prevalence of one institutional logic over another at both the organisational and individual levels may be occasioned by organisational field pressures and opportunities rather than by other intra-organisational conflicts as discussed in most previous literature on PMS and institutional logics.",

The methodology employed was in line with the relevant literature and it serves to achieve the aims and to answer the questions of this study (M\u00e9nac\u00e8re, 2016). Institutional isomorphism produces a greater impact on Libya accounting and auditing practices (Phillips & Jiao, 2016).

Given the growing interest in harmonising the auditing practice, not only by scholars but also by policy and decision-makers, this study is aimed at contributing to improve and develop an under-researched topic in Africa, by expanding the literature on the importance of harmonising auditing practices.

        "abstract": "The Turkish construction industry has achieved rapid growth since the 2000s. The sector plays a significant role for the national economy due to its contribution to job creation, industrialization and economic growth. However, the sector has been widely criticized because of heavy work conditions and high rates of work accidents. The construction industry generally grows faster than GDP in expansion periods and shrinks more during the crisis years. While these fluctuations make the construction industry more unstable, they also affect its employees more negatively than the general economic course during recessions in construction activities. Workplace health and safety standards do not gain priority in a sectoral structure where small and medium-sized companies, subcontractors and contracting services are predominant. On the contrary, the existing structure negatively affects the work conditions and occupational health and safety in many respects. With the growth of the construction sector, while employment rates increase, the rates of occupational accidents, occupational diseases, permanent incapacity and death also go up. Dissatisfaction of the construction workers with the profession and the low prestige attributed to this line of work lead to high labor turnover rates across the sector. The widespread seasonal work in the construction sector as well as the employment of domestic and foreign migrant workers further lower down the labor standards.To fulfil its role in the development of Turkey sustainably and more importantly, to become a decent work area that values human rights, the construction industry needs to provide a more secure and safer work environment. Given the job and social insecurities and the low education of the workforce in general, the sector becomes trapped in a vicious cycle of low skill-low productivity, failing to initiate a sustainable growth pattern based on high value-added production. The sector will continue to show high sensitivity in the face of crises without raising the current work conditions to certain standards through an institutional restructuring. This study aims to identify problems regarding the existent work standards in the Turkish construction sector and to develop policy recommendations for improvement. To this end, in light of the findings obtained from the literature review, an overall assessment of the construction sector and the work conditions is made based on a descriptive analysis of secondary data at sector and firm levels that cover the post-2000 period. In the analysis, data from the Turkish Republic Presidency Strategy and Budget Directorate, TURKSTAT, CBRT and SGK are used. Policy recommendations for improving the workplace standards are developed to enhance the health, skill and job satisfaction of the workers and to achieve a sustainable growth path in the sector.",

        "abstract": "This study explores public sentiment in relation to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) by analysing 18,481 tweets mentioning ACFTA over a three-month period. The findings highlight the dominance of actors outside the African continent in the public discourse on ACFTA thus indicating the importance of the African diaspora and foreign interests in framing the debate and influencing public opinion on the continent. They also highlight the salient issues in the public debate on ACFTA to include its potential effects on national economies and jobs as well as the potential for its exploitation by foreign interests. The study also points at a disconnect between governments and politicians promoting ACFTA on the one hand and the average citizen in Africa on the other as it shows a general negative sentiment in all regions and age groups, and more particularly in West Africa and amongst males towards ACFTA.",

        "publication title": "Academic letter on French Indochina War: Metaphors for strategic insight",
        "abstract": "Pandemics and military catastrophes illustrate systems fragility and impel strategic reflection.  The French Indochina War (FIW) from 1946-1954 furnishes useful insights with resonance for current infectious, climatic, pollution, economic and security challenges.  Five strategic themes structured an analysis of historical literature.  The reasons for the French failure in 1954 involved fundamental regime illegitimacy, political equivocation, intelligence shortcomings, strategic and operational failures but also the determination, strength and adaptability of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh (VM).  In 1945, France had re-occupied Vietnam to re-assert its global credentials.  Later, Cold War logic and American aid sustained \u201cLa sale guerre\u201d.  However, the conflict merely delayed and bloodied an inevitable post-colonial regime shift.  To maintain American aid flows yet retain French regional influence, the commander of the Expeditionary Corps, Henri Navarre, adopted an offensive stance.  He sought to crush the VM, breathe life into the moribund French Union (L\u2019Union fran\u00e7aise) and block Gi\u00e1p\u2019s feints on Laos.  In November 1954, he inserted a fortified camp at remote Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Ph\u00fa (DBP).  However, Navarre ignored the lessons of H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (1950-51), Ngh\u0129a L\u1ed9 (1951).  He misread N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n (1952) and underestimated VM capabilities.  Operationally, the distance of DBP from Hanoi stretched the French aero-logistical system to its limits.  Navarre also diverted resources to sideshow \u2013 Op\u00e9ration Atlante.  Gi\u00e1p realised Navarre had taken the bait and sealed off the besieged camp with five divisions, including an artillery one.  On 13th March, the VM attacked and conquered the garrison after 56 days on the evening of 7-8th May 1954.  Navarre\u2019s gamble had spectacularly backfired.  Militarily, the French Expeditionary Corps might have recovered even considering the bloodbath at Mang Yang Pass almost seven weeks later.  However, the psychological blow unmasked regime financial and political bankruptcy.  Power drained away to the Americans or the communists.  Whilst French Indochina perpetuated an iniquitous social structure, tainted by racism, symbolic and physical violence, it arguably it also protected minorities, spurned dictatorship and transferred culture and technology.The most striking finding that emerges from this investigation is the incredible transformation of the geography of Vietnam since 1948.  Then, tigers and elephant roamed in jungles, 160km North West of Saigon, near Phan Thi\u1ebft.  Today, suburbia encroaches on depleted coffee plantations and desiccated scrub.  Aside from concerns over the long-term ecological trajectories under anthropogenic pressures in ostensibly communist or capitalist inspired systems and, notwithstanding today\u2019s very different context, the detailed investigation into aspects of the War provides strategic metaphors involving fiscal re-calibration, governance hierarchy or incentive regulations, hubristic corrections and ecological transformation",

        "abstract": "The concept of a smart city has attracted the attention of many scholars and policymakers in many countries worldwide. The role of accounting as a tool of governance in smart city politics, however, has so far been largely overlooked, especially in less developed countries (LDCs). This paper sets off to fill this research gap and hitherto unexplored linkages between accounting and smart cities. Drawing on the concept of governmentality, the authors conducted a case study based on document analysis, meetings observation, and 42 semi-structured interviews at a branch of a hybrid electricity company owned by New Cairo City in Egypt, during 2018. Findings show that the case company has implemented smart distribution networks of electricity in which new management accounting technology (enterprise resource planning (ERP) system) is used to trace costs, revenues, client complaints and feedback in a timely manner. The new network (of infrastructure and technologies) has represented timely accounting information as a major political power to influence accurate governance decision-making, such as smart electricity pricing and control, and to challenge governance decisions that are not sound. This paper is one of the first studies to explore the socio-political dynamics of accounting in smart city governance in the context of LDCs.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in automating the production of a large number of forecasts, as often required in many business applications, is the need for robust and reliable predictions. Increased noise, outliers and structural changes in the series, all too common in practice, can severely affect the quality of forecasting. We investigate ways to increase the reliability of exponential smoothing forecasts, the most widely used family of forecasting models in business forecasting. We consider two alternative sets of approaches, one stemming from statistics and one from machine learning. To this end, we adapt M-estimators, boosting and inverse boosting to parameter estimation for exponential smoothing. We propose appropriate modifications that are necessary for time series forecasting while aiming to obtain scalable algorithms. We evaluate the various estimation methods using multiple real datasets and find that several approaches outperform the widely used maximum likelihood estimation. The novelty of this work lies in (1) demonstrating the usefulness of M-estimators, (2) and of inverse boosting, which outperforms standard boosting approaches, and (3) a comparative look at statistics versus machine learning inspired approaches.",

The introduction of the internet and PCs, first of all, cell phones and later smartphones, has changed our daily habits, leading us to be always connected for many hours of the day. Changes that have affected all fields, not least sporting activity, always focused on performance maximization. Technology in sport has made great strides, allowing both amateurs and even more professionals to use innovative technical solutions that can improve performance: first of all during training and then, consequently, in official competitions. Innovations both in the field of materials, but above all in terms of tools for verifying correct training through the collection of a large number of data, turned into carefully analysed useful information. There are sports that have benefited most from these new technologies, based on their particular characteristics. This research focused on a systematic analysis of the most important technologies that are currently allowing great progress in sports performance and in the impartiality of competitions through the analysis of the collected data. In particular, the research highlighted three particular areas of interest: A) video assistant data collectors; b) Wearable technologies; c) Scouting tech-based techniques. ",

        "abstract": "Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from a large number of people, typically via the Internet. Lendwithcare is amongst the first crowdfunding platforms specifically dedicated to support individual and group entrepreneurs in developing countries through partner microfinance institutions. A key objective of Lendwithcare is to identify the attributes (i.e., the characteristics of crowdfunding projects in their online descriptions) that affect investors/potential investors when taking their investment decision. This paper proposes a decision rule-based approach to address this issue. This approach relies on the Dominance-Based Rough Approach (DRSA), which is a well-known multicriteria sorting method. The outputs of DRSA are a collection of if-then decision rules and a collection of attribute reducts. In this paper, new measures are proposed for calculating the relative importance of condition attributes based on the characteristics of decision rules and of attribute reducts. Decision rule-based measures are parameterised in order to consider the characteristics of decision rules using both learning and testing datasets. The proposed measures can be aggregated into a comprehensive measure indicating the overall importance of each condition attribute. Furthermore, the proposed measures are extended in order to compute the relative importance of a collection of condition attributes taken together. In addition, decision rule-based measures are extended to evaluate the relative importance of specific values of condition attributes. The proposed approach has been applied and validated using real-world data from Lendwithcare.",

Our findings show that firms deploy four context-fitting but ethically suspect political strategies: affective, financial, pseudo-attribution and kinship strategies. We leverage this understanding to contribute to CPA in emerging countries by arguing that corporate political strategies are shaped by the reciprocity and duality of dependency relationships between firms and politicians, and also by advancing that these strategies reflect institutional weaknesses and unique industry-level opportunities. Importantly, we shed light on the muttered dark side of CPA. We develop a CPA framework and discuss the research, practical and policy implications of our findings.   ",

Theseresults confirm our hypothesis that the nature of corruption inSSA is such that it encourages and promotes capital flight. Theempirical findings also indicate that the capital flight in SSA countriesis driven mainly by corruption, lag capital flight, external debt,foreign direct investment, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Basedon these results, the paper recommends that governments in theregion should manage their external debt efficiently, and stabilizetheir monetary and macroeconomic policies in order to curtail capitalflight.

Using a sample of 180 companies from 2012 to 2017 (i.e. 1080 firm-year observations) a binary logistic model has been employed to investigate the CG-AQ nexus. This analysis was supported by conducting a probit logistic model as a sensitivity analysis. Our findings are associative of a heterogeneous impact of CG on AQ post the implementation of the 2012 CG reforms in the UK. For example, although institutional ownership and management ownership can predict AQ, board independence, non-executive directors and audit committee are not attributed to AQ in the UK. This implies that corporate compliance with good CG practices has a limited impact on the decision to select a Big4 auditor in the UK. Despite the limitations of our study, we hope it can motivate further investigations in this area.",

        "abstract": "Management of public finance and economic development is the art by which a nation improves the economic, political and social well-being of its people. The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow. The research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error. We have to manage our work and time differently. We are living in a digital and intelligent era, where machines take over repetitive, time-consuming and redundant tasks, giving finance professionals more time to approach higher level and more lucrative analysis and research.",

Using a combination of data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention, Roser et al. (2020) and Hale et al. (2020), we carried cross-country analysis covering 69 countries across the 5 continents. To take care of the fact that the number of Covid-19 cases strongly depend on its own lag values, we used two-step system GMM for the estimations. Unlike prior studies that measure lockdown in terms of a fixed intervention date, we relied on the stringency index from Hale et al. (2020) that accommodates for the gradual lockdown measures in different countries. We found that an exogenous lockdown significantly affects the number of confirmed cases after 7 days of its implementation and its lag effects are intact even after 21 days of its implementation. A one unit change in the lockdown index decreases the total number of confirmed cases by 0.19 percent. Testing has no significant effects for at least 14 days after its implementation. However, after 21 days of its implementation, its effects become significant with \u22120.03 to \u22120.05 elasticity value.",

        "abstract": "Previous research has suggested that share-financed acquirers inflate their earnings before merger announcements. The existing literature also indicates that the characteristics of CEOs could affect earnings management. This research extends prior studies by examining the relationships between CEO characteristics and accrual-based and real earnings management in share-financed acquirers before a merger announcement. It finds that CEOs with financial expertise, long tenure and high reputation are associated with lower abnormal accruals in share-financed M&A deals. However, under real earnings management, only CEOs with financial expertise are associated with lower real earnings management in share-financed M&A deals. The correlations are statistically significant and consistently exist in the first year before the deal announcement. These findings are robust to different measures of abnormal accruals and real earnings activities and estimations employing different models. The evidence suggests that CEO characteristics have an impact on earnings management in the context of share-financed M&A and have some implications for practitioners.",

We compare abnormal accruals prior to a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deal announcement between acquirers that had director networks in the target firms and those who did not. Under cash-financed M&A deals, we do not find a significant difference in accrual earnings management between these two types of firms. Our analysis, however, shows that share- and hybrid-financed acquirers with director networks increase accrual earnings significantly in the first and second years prior to the M&A deal, while those without director networks increase accruals earnings in the first year prior to the M&A deal. Our findings suggest that less uncertainty about the M&A deal and a stronger bargaining position in the negotiations for acquirers with director networks allow these firms to strategically time and confidently inflate their accruals earnings.",

Using a sample of European listed financial firms over 2005-2011, our analysis confirms prior literature that the value relevance of book value of equity increases, while that of net income decreases during the financial crisis. More importantly, our findings offer robust support for the hypothesis that the impact of the crisis is less pronounced for firms whose financial statements are more exposed to fair value accounting. This evidence can be explained by the increased valuation weight placed by investors on the book value of equity relative to net income for firms with more exposure to fair value in the pre-crisis period.

We establish analytic conditions under which financial contagion propagates in the core-periphery network and examine the extent to which heterogeneity associated with size and number of banks affects these conditions.  We show that the failure of core banks does not necessarily imply contagious failure of periphery banks; the core-periphery network structure exhibits a \u2018robust-yet-fragile\u2019 tendency with increased size of core banks; and the resilience of the network to contagion depends on the number of core banks, the number of periphery banks, and the level of interbank liquidity intermediated between the core banks.

        "abstract": "PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the effects of the early adoption of International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) on Financial Market Indicators (FMIs) from a diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory perspective.Design/methodology/approachUsing panel data from 110 countries in a period that spans from 1995 to 2014, this study applies an ordinary least squares regression model to investigate the financial consequences of adopting ISAs. This analysis was supplemented with estimating a fixed-effects and two-stage least squares regression models to address any concerns regarding the possible existence of endogeneity problems.FindingsThis study reports three key findings. First, the authors find that early ISAs adoption has a negative effect on several financial market consequences, namely stock market integration, market capitalisation, market turnover, market return, market development, stock price volatility and stock trading volume. Second, using an alternative measure to the one that is proposed by DOI theory, the authors found that some financial indicators have been significantly improved after ISAs adoption, but only for listed firms that prepared their financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards and audited by ISAs simultaneously. Finally, the financialindicators of European stock markets, however, have insignificantly shrank post the mandatory adoption of ISAs in 2006.Practical implicationsThe empirical evidence raises questions about how ISAs were enforced and implemented. For example, countries that adopted ISAs at early stages may have been dominated mostly by recently established stock exchanges. This implies a crucial need to determine and apply the best type of auditing regime that can increase investors trust and enhance the credibility of stock markets information, which might ultimately advance the FMIs over time significantly.Originality/valueTo-date, studies investigating the impact of the adoption of ISAs on FMI from a DOI theory perspective are virtually non-existent. The study, therefore, seeks to contribute to the extant literature by examining the influence of ISAs adoption on a wide range of FMIs.",

        "abstract": "Since the financial crisis, risk management has been of growing interest to investors and the approach of Value-at-Risk has gained wide acceptance. Investing in Cryptocurrencies brings not only huge rewards but also huge risks. For this purpose, this paper investigates whether Cryptocurrencies investors\u2019 decisions can rely on the pragmatic and parsimonious approaches for Value-at-Risk forecasting. Specifically, we suggest a parsimonious reflected gamma specification under the GAS framework, consider other GAS special cases and the Exponential Weights driven nonparametric methods, which fall into the same modelling category as the well-known and widely recognised original RiskMetrics\u2122 approach. We focus on the returns for BTC, LTC and ETH and find that progress upon RiskMetricks\u2122 may provide valuable gains in exposure modelling of Cryptocurrencies under the rough and primary backtesting conditions, though not all of the considered approaches demonstrate consistency at the selected risk confidence levels. In our setting, Laplace GAS specification, which controls for time-variation both in scale (volatility) and skewness (asymmetric responses to positive and negative volatility) parameters, performs the best at the most of the levels. We also find that controlling for time-variation in the degrees of freedom (tails) of the Student's  may be a worthwhile consideration, though such approach may still yield more conservative investors\u2019 strategies than its Laplace asymmetric alternative. Reflected gamma and Extreme Value Theory linked Double Pareto specifications also demonstrate a modest performance, but likely suffer from the lack of asymmetry in their parameters, as our Reflected Gamma parametrisation accounts for time-variation in the tails, unlike Pareto specifications and does not outperform asymmetric Laplace specification. Data- driven nonparametric methods seem to struggle the most in approximating downside tail risks due to the sharp corrections in Cryptocurrencies\u2019 value.",

This study sets precepts of the traditional fraud triangle theory against external auditors\u2019 actual perceptions, particularly in relation to the assessment of Fraudulent Financial Reporting Risk (FFRR). The findings reveal a significant mismatch, indicating that the traditional fraud triangle model is not suitable for the assessment of FFRR. Auditors should not only focus on which factors to consider in fraud risk assessment, but also on the relative importance of the factors. In the case of fraudulent financial reporting, the results suggest that without understanding managers\u2019 motivations and levels of integrity, auditors are unlikely to detect fraud and bias in financial statements. Auditors also advised considering fraud perpetrators\u2019 capabilities in the assessment of FFRR and viewing rationalisation as a red flag for low management integrity rather than a separate fraud factor. This study has important policy and practice implications, proposing a new practice-based model aimed at enhancing auditors\u2019 skills in the assessment of FFRR. ",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to examine the level of disclosure on content elements of integrated reporting (IR) in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales higher education institutions (HEIs). The authors suggest that integrated thinking is an internal process that organizations can follow to increase the level of disclosure on IR that can be used as an effective mechanism to enhance accountability with stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) guidelines and content analysis are used to analyze IR content elements in HEI reports from 2014-2016. Findings: The results indicate a significant increase in the trend and extent of IR content elements. The HEI-specific characteristics examined, such as establishment of HEI; adoption of IR framework and governing board size are all statistically and positively associated with IR content elements disclosure. This paper introduces signalling theory to explore the idea that appropriate communication via integrated thinking can close the gap between the organization and its stakeholders via increased level of disclosure on IR content elements. Practical implications: The results will assist policymakers and regulators to assess the benefits of voluntary implementation of IR at HEIs and evaluate possible mandatory implementation of IIRC guidelines. Second, the findings can assist managers of institutions interested in implementing IR. Social implications: This study recommends universities to explicitly address IR issues in reporting, as this will increase their impact as leaders of educational thought in addition to their roles as partners, advisors, counselors and assessors. Originality/value: This study explores whether HEIs in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales provide disclosure on IIRC content elements as a reflection of integrated thinking and whether the connectivity and interdependence between different departments will help to signal to stakeholders how HEIs create value for society.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates, theoretically and empirically, the impact of corporate hedging activities on firm value/performance. In a perfect market, with self-less management, aiming to maximise shareholder wealth, it may be expected that hedging would improve firm performance and add value. Our major contribution in this paper is that we first demonstrate theoretically the conditions under which hedging can increase or decrease firm value. Our theoretic model demonstrates that the ambiguous relationship between hedging and firm value may be due to a subtle combination of economic (managerial self-interest, agency problems/moral hazard, managerial ability, managerial risk aversion) and behavioural factors (overconfidence). Our empirical analysis confirms the ambiguous effect of hedging on firm performance. Empirically, we focus on the use of derivatives in the corporate hedging of three types of financial risk (foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks), and examine the effect on value and performance of listed UK corporations during 2005-2017. We demonstrate that the positive or negative effects of the hedging strategies varies significantly across both the financial risk that is hedged and the type of derivatives contracts used in the hedging as well as the time period in consideration.

        "abstract": "Using institutional holdings data for 1993\u20132015, we investigate whether institutional herding is spurious or intentional by analysing the impact on herding of analyst recommendation revisions and sentiment. In addition to examining their effect separately, we consider the impact of their interaction. Utilising the Sias method, we develop competing hypotheses concerning spurious and intentional herding, an issue of direct interest to fund investors, given the principal-agent relationship inherent in fund management. Results strongly suggest herding is spurious. Analysis of the relationship between herding and subsequent returns, and findings from robustness tests add further support.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on bank efficiency and how such efficiencies are expected to influence bank shareholder value upon merger announcements. It employs stochastic frontier analysis and event study methods along with regression analysis to account for the influences of pre-merger and post-merger efficiencies of bidders and targets in assessing their impact on bidder abnormal returns. Using data for a sample of large commercial bank M&As from 22 European countries, the authors find that bank bidders achieve short-term shareholder value gains from merger announcements and this could be associated with the perceived efficiencies of bidders and targets. More generally, the evidence supports the view that bank profit efficiency has a positive influence on bidder returns from merger announcements, and therefore markets do take into account the importance of efficiency in value creation. This suggests that stock markets price operational efficiency of banks in predicting value gains from European Bank M&As.",

        "abstract": "All sports have their roots and connection in some way to the Olympic spirit, and therefore fall within the vision and mission of the Olympic Committee, which has a central aim of \u201cbuilding a better world\u201d. This is a fundamental value of the Olympics and sustainability is a \u201cworking principle\u201d of this. This research analyses the performance of professional European football teams that are publicly listed on stock markets, analysing their income statements and factoring in how the value-added perspective is impacting professional sport. The methodology we use considers the sustainable contribution of the distribution of added value. The Value-Added Statement is considered as a part of broader Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which can be traced back as a concept to the late 1970s. It is still in widespread use and is regarded as being both a credible and a tested measure. In this paper, the authors apply a slightly modified and simplified version of this value-added approach to all publicly listed European football clubs and use these as a proxy for wider professional sport. This research demonstrates that, although most professional sports clubs are profit-oriented, the distribution of wealth generated by the added value is unbalanced. In most cases, at least in financial terms, the data shows shareholders are the most disadvantaged, whereas athletes are the most rewarded",

To achieve this, a sample size of 50 listed companies from the Nigerian financial sector was selected for the years 2013\u20132017, resulting in 250 observations. The study employed the use of hierarchical regression analysis to test the impact of risk governance variables (Chief Risk Officer_centrality, Enterprise Risk Management_index, Chief Risk Officer_presence, Board Risk Committee_size, Board Risk Committee_activism, and Board Risk Committee_independence) and other control variables such as corporate governance variables (Board Size and Board of Directors_independence) and firm characteristics variables (Firm size and firm age) on cybercrime. The study observed from the findings that almost all the explanatory variables present a positive and significant relationship with cybercrime, except the Chief Risk Officer_presence, firm age and Board Risk Committee_size which revealed an insignificant relationship with cybercrime. The study concludes that risk governance variables and other variables are likely to reduce and minimize the impact of cybercrime on the sampled firms used in this study.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the association between controlling shareholders' ownership (CS_Own) and firms' leverage decisions in the Singaporean context. We examine whether the impact of ownership concentration on leverage differs across excess and lower control. We report that shareholders with excess control prefer leverage financing for an optimal capital structure and focus on value maximisation rather using leverage as a tool of minority shareholders' expropriation. Our analysis shows that firms capital structure significantly influences by the coalition of shareholders particularly decisions about leverage financing in addition to the firms' specific characteristics and institutional arrangements. Our empirical evidence shows that controlling shareholders with a lower fraction of equity are more concerned about limited holding thus prefer leverage over equity financing to inflate their equity stake to protect them from the potential takeovers and mergers. We report that capital structure decisions in Singapore are linked with the trade-off between the controlling shareholders' target of mitigating firm risk and their non-dilution entrenchment needs. Further, we found an inverted U-shaped association between control ownership and leverage financing. In terms of moderating effect of family-controlled ownership, our findings exhibit that leverage financing is less pronounced for family firms in Singapore due to the under-diversified investment portfolio.",

        "abstract": "Drafting a systematic literature review on sustainable integration of supply chain and logistics is the main aim of this research paper, given the current needs expressed by academics, managers, and investors. Business sustainability, among all management tasks, heavily depends on successful integration between supply chain and logistics. Scholarly and academic double-blinded peer-reviewed journals, indexed in Scopus and EBSCO, are considered, in a time range between the years 2010 and 2019. Thus, summaries of journals are comprehensively assessed to appraise the integration between Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics in business markets. Through this work paper, the procedures behind an effective application of supply chain models are investigated in order to improve knowledge, in terms of recent advancements. The authors develop and carry out an effective business-case analysis, in which the application of Supply Chain Management and logistics procedures led to advancements in the field, therefore their systematic review will be beneficial in terms of a comprehensive current framework provision. According to the analyze explored by the authors, Decision Support Systems and computer frameworks really support business leaders in using Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics information and models, further providing specific training. The research paper observed that, indeed, a systematic review is an effective tool that encourages a thorough understanding of the key features related to the specific field. Despite limitations due to a small number of studies carried out on the specific topic, we strongly believe that this research will provide a great contribution to business management, towards an exhaustive, useful, and insightful analysis of the current studies on the integration between Sustainable Supply Chain Management and logistics applications.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents an agent-based model of a credit economy which includes a securitisation process and a bailout mechanism for bank bankruptcies. Within this framework, banks are able to sell mortgages to a financial vehicle corporation, which finances its activity by creating mortgage-backed securities and selling them to a mutual fund. In turn, the mutual fund collects liquidity by selling shares to households and remunerates them with a monthly interest. The impact of this mechanism is analysed by means of computational experiments for different levels of banks\u2019 securitisation propensity. Furthermore, we study a set of systemic risk indicators which have the aim of assessing the imbalances in the financial system. Two of them are the mortgage-to-GDP ratio and the capital adequacy ratio, which are constructed to detect only the on-balance sheet changes in banks\u2019 credit exposure. We consider two additional indicators, similar to the previous ones with the only difference that they are also able to account for the off-balance sheet items. Moreover, we adopt an indicator, the so-called \u201cvirtuous\u2013unvirtuous cycle\u201d indicator, which, besides off-balance assets, targets also the GDP. The results show that higher securitisation propensity weakens the financial stability of banks with relevant effects on different sectors of the economy. Most importantly, the analysis of systemic risk reveals the important issue of designing suitable systemic risk indicators for predicting incoming financial crises, finding that an essential feature of these indicators should be to integrate banks\u2019 off-balance sheet assets.",

        "abstract": "Since the dawn of time, man has always tried to predict the future. Inserted in an environmental context, the knowledge of the variables that influenced his life allowed him to reap daily benefits and ultimately ensured his survival. Weather forecasts, bets on sports results, financial analysis, estimation of life span probabilities, to name just a few examples, are based on increasingly accurate estimates thanks to increasingly efficient statistical techniques and detection tools. Risk and uncertainty, however, although increasingly limited, represent an essential variable of any future event. The possibility of measuring and preventing (even if close to their occurrence) unlikely, but potentially catastrophic events, can determine extraordinary competitive advantages or even just guarantee the survival of a business or human existence. Unlikely events, but catastrophic, are the so-called \"black swans\"[1], and represent the nightmare of those who rely on the Gaussian approach, since, even if they fall into the tails of the bell, they represent a non-negligible threat. Studies on the black swan, especially after the events linked to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, have brought to light the so-called fractal approach that comes closest to the occurrence of most natural events. The analysis of big data, focused on the identification of the black swan, can follow different paths, in any case, the \"normal\"Gauss curve, as demonstrated, does not lend itself to this type of analysis, therefore most of the statistical tools which are based on this are not suitable for these analyses. This research highlights and tries to demonstrate how the fractal approach, combined with quantum technology, could really represent a great advance in the reliability of future predictions and the detection of black swans.

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role colonial ties play in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ghana, several years after the official end of colonisation in the African continent. Colonisation left behind legacies of institutional framework, social ties and remnants of companies of colonial masters, which could potentially offer contemporary businesses from home countries the benefits of country of origin agglomeration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses sequential explanatory mixed research design through 101 questionnaires and 8 interviews from the UK companies with FDI in Ghana. This approached enabled the initial quantitative results to be explored further through the qualitative data. Findings: Colonial ties have limited influence on contemporary flow of FDI to Ghana, in spite of the institutional legacies between former colonisers and colonies. Majority of UK companies are influenced by agglomeration opportunities in general rather than country of origin agglomeration. However, country of origin agglomeration remains important to over a third of the companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: The sample was taken from the non-extractive industry in Ghana, and caution must be applied in generalising the findings. However, some universal issues concerning agglomeration and institutions are discussed. Originality/value: Although there has been some research on colonial history and its impact on FDI in Africa, existing knowledge on bilateral relations is rather limited. Unlike previous studies, this research provides depth by examining colonial influence on FDI between two countries, using two key concepts: country of origin agglomeration and institutions. It provides UK companies with contemporary views to consider when exploring FDI opportunities in Ghana, particularly in relation to the effects of the colonial history. It also provides investment promotion agencies with empirical results on the importance of various forms of agglomeration and institutions for FDI attraction.",

        "abstract": "The UK is believed to hold prolific reserves of shale gas; the quality of which has been compared and sometimes branded superior to the much successful US shale plays. Nonetheless, after more than ten years since the 13th Onshore Licensing Round, the fracking industry is said to have benefited from just \u00a3400 million - \u00a3500 million of estimated investments and only one partially fracked well with yet an uncertain fate of commercial production. This paradox motivated the current research. Based on a discounted cash flow model, the economic feasibility of the tax regime was evaluated with a  special interest in the pad allowance [PA], a major incentive of the fiscal regime. We find that the design of the fiscal regime well achieves the Government's financial objectives, but fails to support shale gas investments at lower gas prices. PA introduces further variability in investor cash flows, ultimately defeating the ethos of the incentive. We propose a reduction in the overall tax rate from 40% to no more than 21%; a removal of the additional tax charge (Supplementary Charge) and an amendment of PA rules to; (1) allow an extension of RFES to PA; (2) permit transfer of activated PA across companies in the same group; and (3) redefine capital expenditure to include intermediate well retirement costs necessary to drill new wells to stimulate production. Such a tax strategy would simplify and align the UK fiscal regime with practices across the US, China, Algeria and Canada. Importantly, it would better match the risk of shale gas investments to its rewards and could better attract investments. We recommend the strategy for emerging unconventional oil and gas producing countries for an efficient design of their fiscal regimes.",

We also assess the impact of returns\u2019 smoothing schemes on shareholders\u2019 wealth, namely the use of reserves and/or subsidies to adjust cash returns to investment account holders. We find that the value of PSIAs varies widely amongst banks, and that originating high-quality assets dominates returns\u2019 smoothing in the value creation process. We also find that if subsidies are used without reserves to smooth returns, then shareholders\u2019 wealth is destroyed in the long term for 77% of banks in our sample.

It is stated that the use of advanced information technologies in the banking sector of the economy (which was gradually formalized into the concept of \u201conline banking\u201d) has greatly facilitated the implementation of financial transactions, in particular, minimized the physical circulation of money. The purpose of the article is to study the features and principles of online banking on the example of the Italian bank WIDIBA. Methodical support of the paper includes a method of analysis of specific situations. The key components of the case method of the study are: research on the basis of literature review; formalization of key theses (issues) in the context of the unresolved part of the study; accumulation and analysis of collected information; identification of key features of the issue. This research was carried out in the light of two aspects: the strategic principles of the spread of online banking in Italy; digital technologies in the context of the strategic perspective of the Italian bank WIDIBA. The paper considers the historical aspects of the introduction and use of online banking services. It is noted that in Italy today there are 207 publicly registered commercial establishments, of which 81 are located abroad, and 6 operate mostly in the format of providing online banking services. The object of this research is the activity of the Italian bank WIDIBA, which is justified by its valuable practical experience in formalizing a plan of adequate timely strategy for entering the market of online banking services on the basis of a carefully developed development strategy. The theoretical researches were carried out in the work, in particular, in the following directions: definition of strategic actions of bank establishment according to a time lag of functioning; analysis of the budget of the banking institution (net profitability, interest margin, operating and administrative expenses, etc.); analysis of the income statement of the bank (the ratio of net profit and loss, interest margin and brokerage margin); work with financial report or balance sheet data on the structure of assets, liabilities and investments, retained earnings; study of trend dynamics of cash flows (operational, financial, investment and free cash flows). Excellent strategies are analyzed, which demonstrate how the banking sector is extremely dynamic and, that technological investments still allow easier access to new operators in case of the implementation of innovation strategies.",

        "abstract": "Rapid revolution in technology has influenced every field, including the manufacturing sector, where digitalisation becoming an essential factor in industrial transformation. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the impact of smart technologies will transform leadership decision making in the coming decade. It is anticipated that the leadership style will change from egocentric to altrocentric. This study will focus on the role of leadership in the future using artificial intelligence and smart technologies in the manufacturing sector of Wales, considering how current leaders may utilise applications of AI to achieve organisational goals (revolution 4.0). This research will follow a pragmatic approach. The convergent design of mixed methods will be used for collecting quantitative and qualitative data. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews will be conducted to collect data from up to 20 managers in the manufacturing sector of Wales. Additionally, this study will use survey method to collect data from approximately 150 participants involved in decision making role in the manufacturing sector of Wales, including supervisors, assistant managers, and managers. Thematic analysis will be used to analyse qualitative data and SPSS to analyse quantitative data. This study is at an early stage, and data still needs to be collected. Organisations are hesitant to use AI in decision making because they believe it is not entirely reliable for all types of decisions in organisations (Guszcza et al., 2017; Dejoux & L\u00e9on, 2018; Jarrahi, 2018; Guszcza et al., 2017; Parry et al., 2016; Sadler-Smith and Shefy, 2004). Therefore, if we can overcome these fears, AI could be a key component of competitive advantage for manufacturing firms operating in Wales, and could empower the decision making for leaders/managers.",

Most existingstudies of the effects of sanctions and blockades, whether bilateral ormultilateral, are conducted from the perspective of the initiating or \u2018sender\u2019country, which is typically a great power, e.g., the United States. However,there is a lack of literature on the possible policies that target nations maydevelop to prevent compromising their security, especially economic security,as well as neutralize the negative impact of sanctions. Sanctions and blockadesdisrupt the flow of international trade in goods, services and capital. Thesehave consequences for the composition of output, employment, consumptionand investment, and may also exert substantial effects on households, firmsand government expenditures in targeted nations. Thus, it is important tounderstand the effects of blockades and sanctions on economic growth andpublic expenditure on security, military, health and education. Apart from thelong-run growth consequences of sanctions and blockades, many of themacroeconomic effects are likely to be relatively short-lived, decaying overtime as the economy adjusts to sanctions. Therefore, econometric techniquesapplied to investigate the impact of sanctions should be able to capture thesimultaneous interplay between economic outcomes, political factors andadjustment processes, as in reality economics and politics are inseparable",

We argue there is a genuine reason to choose Islamic debt because it has lighter indebtedness, benefits of avoiding external monitoring, and tax incentives. Based on the cross-country data for 346 firms issuing dollar-denominated global sukuk and bonds, we find that firms that prefer Islamic debt and issue sukuk are financially more unstable, and thus exposing to higher insolvency risk as compared to bond issuing firms.",

Based on the opinion of the staff and students of top 10 public and private universities (according to the University Grant Commission report 2018) in Bangladesh, the study found that there is some evidence of the inclusion of sustainability issues onto the faculty's mission and vision statements, but very few are incorporated into the program curricula. Besides, lacking sustainability training to the teachers provokes their failure of providing education for sustainable development.

        "abstract": "Accounting Information Systems (AISs) are fundamental for the recording of the accounting transactions of any company and for the preparation of financial statements, as required by the legislation on financial accounting. However, information systems are not only limited to accounting for the management of a company, but it is often necessary to implement additional information systems to manage other operational aspects such as inventory management, personnel, security, big data management for marketing and the provision of a broad corporate strategy. All these aspects, in general, in order to lead the company towards success, must be integrated with each other. Many software can manage all these aspects of management, but they do not allow integrated management and top management cannot control and reconcile all information. For this reason Enterprise resource plannings (ERPs), formed by different modules, are very common. ERPs allow the flow of information to be managed in an integrated manner using a single system, avoiding duplication, errors and loss and information. All the operations are reported systematically also and above all on the accounting module, which is the one that guides all the others. This research paper is focused on the comparison of currently most used AISs and ERPs in the UAE, also analyzing the market and the size of businesses in the area. The research highlighted the opportunities and limitations of the information systems currently available, as well as the characteristics of the companies that determined the dissemination of the programs in use.",

The methodology established by the risk management standard-setting body for Islamic banks, the IFSB, estimates an alpha for each country using panel-data and normally distributed asset returns for its credit institutions. Consequently, the IFSB methodology precludes bank-specific alphas linked to the actual risk profile of underlying assets. There is also no discernible mapping between alpha and a bank's own propensity to subsidise cash returns. This paper instead develops a new theoretical model for bank-specific alpha that is estimated for 43 Islamic banks in 11 countries. Our alpha values broadly correspond with those of the IFSB. However, a form of regulatory arbitrage is shown to exist which favors banks with relatively high alphas. This finding also has policy implications for bank efficiency and systemic risk.",

We employ the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) based panel regression on the annual data from 54 insurance companies over 2012 and 2016. The findings of the study show that governance mechanism has a significant impact on the performance of the insurance companies under review. Increase of independent members of the board has a negative influence on the financial performance of Malaysian insurance companies while such relationship is not statistically significant for insurance companies in Bangladesh. Additionally, findings suggest that board size has a significant positive impact on the financial performance of the insurance companies. Finally, the study provides new evidence on agency relationship for insurance firms in emerging markets and contributes to the literature by addressing the fact that the increased involvement of non-executive members on the board of insurance companies might lead to poor financial performance. Findings of this study can provide guidance to regulators in designing governance mechanism that caters for insurance firms.",

Currently, Indonesia has 453 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of CBM reserves. However, CBM development in the country is still in the exploration phase, with significant under-investment. To attract investors, a tailored Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) regime is required. Based on a combination of Factor Analysis (FA), Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) and Parameter Sensitivity Analysis, the research explores an optimal scenario of a company\u2019s share of revenue that optimised CBM development contracts. We find that a combination of 5 years straight line depreciation (SLD), 5% First Tranche Petroleum (FTP), 78% Contractor Share (CS) and 35% income tax best spreads the risk of CBM development and exploitation between the government and the contractor. This combination is a more suitable PSC regime for developing CBM in an early stage of the industry. Therefore, the Government must cede some taxes during exploration to incentivise CBM development. Three PSCs regimes are thus required to fully develop and exploit CBM, including exploration, transitional and exploitation phase PSCs which better match contractor risks and returns and ensure reasonable certainty of contractor cost recovery.",

Sukuk were first launched in Malaysia and are presently available in 29 countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Despite the global market prevalence of sukuk, asset pricing literature has not yet addressed the pricing mechanism of sukuk, which is inherently different from bonds and equity due to the contractual differences. However, analysts use LIBOR, or the Islamic interbank benchmark rate (IIBR), as the ad-hoc benchmark to evaluate sukuk performance. In this study, we develop a basic pricing model that captures the common risks in sukuk returns. We identify two risk factors for sukuk that require risk premiums: (i) sukuk market risk and (ii) information asymmetry risk. Using these two common sukuk risk factors, investment analysts can estimate the fair value of sukuk more precisely than other ad hoc measures available.",

In this chapter, we evaluate the Chinese government\u2019s policy and practice in this area and discuss the fundamental issues, including ownership structure and the establishment of corporate governance, and how the latter interacts with the internal and external institutional environments. Further, we perform an empirical analysis of its role in business growth by examining mergers and acquisitions taking place in China, presenting evidence to show how its practice has influenced value creation and company growth, providing significant insights into the problems and prospects of corporate governance in China today. Overall, our study highlights the need for the government to accelerate the reform of the ownership structure, so as to give managers incentives to maximise company value. Ultimately, it is imperative to install and maintain an effective corporate governance mechanism, under which board independence is real and not merely decorative, and directors\u2019 decision-making is guided and constrained by sound and transparently applied principles.Our findings clearly indicate the extent to which China\u2019s system of corporate governance has so far failed to achieve its objectives, and in what ways it must be reformed and developed in order to enhance market credibility, enterprise competitiveness and economic growth. Our evidence will be of value to China in policy development and practice, as well as to other economies that have pursued, or will pursue, similar trajectories.

The study based on eight years' data for 455 banks and 137 insurance firms from 28 countries finds that insurance firms have a low-quality corporate board as compared to banks. The reasons include: Insurance firms, in comparison to banks, are less likely to have an audit committee and infrequently meeting if they have an audit committee, high existence of CEO duality and involvement in the nomination committees, long-serving CEOs, gender imbalance in the board, fewer independent directors, and higher percentage of directors' ownership. The findings persist across all subsamples except that insurance companies operating in highly corrupt countries have a superior quality board in contrast to a bank. Finally, we confirm that higher agency problem leads to the deterioration of the quality of Insurance boards relative to those of the banks.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThis study aims to examine the mechanisms that were being used to enhance board accountability of Ghanaian listed banks, and how board accountability can be improved.Design/methodology/approachThe 2011 and 2016 annual reports of listed banks on the Ghana Stock Exchange were examined, and a survey questionnaire was sent to board members of nine banks.FindingsThe results show that the directors of Ghanaian listed banks prioritise a shareholder approach to accountability, with a shift towards stakeholders. Audit committees, external audits and internal audits were the main mechanisms used by these banks to enhance board accountability. Some of these mechanisms were not used effectively by a number of these banks.Practical implicationsBoard accountability can be improved by appointing very competent people to the board, the national adoption of a mandatory code of corporate governance, regular rotation of external auditors and requiring non-executive directors to stand for re-election more frequently. Our research identifies weaknesses of accountability mechanisms and offers timely recommendations for banks and regulators to build stronger corporate governance systems.Originality/valueThis study obtained valuable opinions of the boards of directors, provides insights on boards of Ghanaian listed banks and contributes to the literature of corporate governance and accountability in Africa.",

        "abstract": "This study uses face-to-face administered questionnaires to examine consumer behaviour in relation to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of 21 popular apparel companies in the UK. The results show that consumers' awareness of CSR practices and the impact of CSR factors on their purchasing decisions are low, which are key obstacles for companies to reap strategic rewards for their CSR efforts. CSR factors have less influence on consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions than other product attributes; however, consumers have high expectations of companies\u2019 CSR practices. Consumers expect companies to engage in CSR initiatives that benefit local communities, employees, and workers in suppliers\u2019 factories.This paper provides key insights for UK apparel companies to engage their customers and gain competitive advantage for their CSR efforts. With these insights, companies are better informed on consumers\u2019 perceptions and expectations of CSR to benchmark against competitors, and to improve their CSR practices.

A growing amount of research is concerned with the phenomenon that CSR has a minor effect on actual purchases although CSR practices enhance consumers\u2019 purchase intentions.

The purpose of this paper is to further understand this paradox.Design/methodology/approachQuestionnaires were administered face-to-face to consumers in Birmingham. These questionnaires concern consumer behaviour in relation to CSR practices of 21 popular apparel companies in the UK.FindingsResults suggest that consumers\u2019 pro-social priority is significantly related to pro-social consumption and that consumers\u2019 awareness of CSR practices is insignificantly associated with their purchase behaviour.

        "abstract": "The aim of this article is to analyze the economic aspects of cybersecurity of critical infrastructure defined as physical or virtual systems and assets that are vital to a country\u2019s functioning and whose incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national, economic, military and public security. The functioning of modern states, firms and individuals increasingly relies on digital or cyber technologies and this trend has also materialized in various facets of critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure presents a new cybersecurity area of attacks and threats that requires the attention of regulators and service providers. Deploying critical infrastructure systems without suitable cybersecurity might make them vulnerable to intrinsic failures or malicious attacks and result in serious negative consequences. In this article a fuller view of costs and losses associated with cyberattacks that includes both private and external (social) costs is proposed.  An application of the cost-benefit analysis or the Return on Security Investment (ROSI) indicator is presented to evaluate the worthiness of cybersecurity efforts and analyze the costs associated with some major cyberattacks in recent years.  The \u201cIdentify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover\u201d (IPDRR) framework of organizing cybersecurity efforts is also proposed as well as an illustration as to how the blockchain technology could be utilized to improve security and efficiency within a critical infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Timely access to data and information has always been the key to the success of every business. A merchant who can find goods, before anyone else, at a lower price, may succeed in obtaining a higher profit margin for the resale, the researcher who first manages to discover a chemical formula or to invent a new design, can sale a new product. Therefore, science must always face a terrible trade-off between the private need to make profits and the social opportunity of scientific development. Information and knowledge undoubtedly represent a valuable competitive advantage for those who hold them [1-2]. The data holders, in order to continue to benefit from this advantage, try in every way to protect their secrecy. Innovation is a creative process, generated by the human mind, driven by completely different potential factors. Some economic theories claim that innovation is driven by competition. Conversely, other more recent theories highlight the advantages produced by information sharing [3-6]. In this research paper, the author provides a systematic overview of the main factors that (a) influence decisions, (b) limit the development and dissemination of ideas [7], (c) guarantee economic growth. The analysis provided represents an effective tool for companies and policy makers to understand the standard patterns of the data and information flows and the key factors that drive the innovation, the development, and the growth of the world economy.",

        "abstract": "Do compensation consultants drive up CEO pay for the benefit of managers, or do they design pay packages to benefit firm owners? Using a large sample of UK firms from the FTSE All-Share Index over the 2003\u20132011 period, we show a positive correlation between the presence of compensation consultants and CEO pay. Importantly, isolating this effect is somewhat dependent on the endogenous selection of consultants and the statistical modelling strategy deployed. We find evidence that compensation consultants improve CEO compensation design when their expertise is of greater importance (e.g. during the post-financial crisis period, or for firms that have particularly weak compensation policies). In addition, our findings show that compensation consultants increase CEO pay\u2013performance sensitivity. The balance of evidence supports optimal contracting theory more than managerial power theory, but the authors caution the limits to this verification. We are careful to note that the more compelling evidence for the positive effect of pay consultants on CEOs is based on advanced methods (such as propensity score matching and difference-in-differences), and that more standard approaches (such as OLS and fixed effects) are unlikely to reveal the same level of causality of consultants on CEO pay.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of transparency and disclosure on the financial performance of financial institutions. The emphasis is on assessing transparency and disclosure; auditing and compliance; risk management as indicators of corporate governance; and understanding how these parameters affect bank profitability, liquidity and the quality of loan portfolios. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 20 financial institutions was selected, with ten respondents from each, yielding a total sample size of 200. Principal component analysis (PCA), with inbuilt ability to check for composite reliability, was used to obtain composite indices for the corporate governance indicators as well as the indicators of financial performance, based on a set of questions framed for each institution. Findings: The analysis demonstrates that greater disclosure and transparency, improved auditing and compliance and better risk management positively affect the financial performance of financial institutions. In terms of significance, the results show that as the level of disclosure and transparency in managerial affairs increases, the performance of financial institutions \u2013 as measured in terms of the quality of loan portfolios, liquidity and profitability \u2013 increases by 0.3046, with the effect being statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Furthermore, as the level of auditing and the degree of compliance with banking regulations increases, the financial performance of banks improves by 0.3309. Research limitations/implications: This paper did not consider time series because corporate governance does not change periodically. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates the importance of disclosure and transparency in managerial affairs because the performance of financial institutions, as measured in terms of loan portfolios, liquidity and profitability, increases by 0.4 when transparency and disclosure improve, with this effect being statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Originality/value: The use of primary data in assessing the impact of corporate governance on financial performance, instead of secondary data, is the primary novelty of this study. Moreover, PCA is used to assess the weight of the various parameters.",

        "abstract": "This paper identifies, evaluates, and analyses the resulting impact of mandatory expensing of Share-Based Compensation (SBC) under IFRS2/FASB123R on a set of widely used performance measures in the EU and US banking industry. The paper shows that the accounting treatment of SBC schemes, following the mandatory adoption of IFRS2/FAS123R, has a statistically significant negative impact on the selected performance measures over the period 2004-2011. The impact also seems to be material, yet modest, for US banks and only for large and high growth EU banks, indicating that earlier public concerns and criticisms of the implementation of IFRS2/FAS123R are largely unsubstantiated. The findings also show that banks continue to use SBC, but there is a reduction, albeit insignificant, in the recognised SBC expense over the period 2009-2011. That is, earlier public concerns that firms would curtail employing SBC in their employees\u2019 compensation schemes to avoid the effect of SBC expense recognition on their financial ratios came to light after the first option life-cycle in the post-adoption period was over. The findings also show a marked movement towards using cash-settled based payments, possibly due to their manipulative accounting treatment, a potentially interesting issue for related accounting research and accounting standard-setters.",

However, it is imperative to know how business enterprises alter such concern. Recent studies involve a variety of firm-level factors to create a robust link between business enterprises' environmental and financial performance. However, little is known regarding the role of research and development (R&D) investment on firms' environmental performance. Using a firm-level data for the period 2004\u20132016 from G-6 countries, this study empirically investigates how R&D investment affects the firm environmental performance measured by energy and carbon emissions intensities. We find that R&D investment improves the firm's environmental performance consistent with the theoretical argument of natural resource-based view (NRBV).

This study builds on previous research at Coventry University (Williamson and Wick 2013 and Smith et al 2017) in order to see if the high E Irates recorded at Coventry University are replicated across other institutions. It reports on the response of students from two UK HEI Business Schools (Coventry and Birmingham City University \u2013 BCU), entering undergraduate study in 2018. The study will compare data collected during induction week, before any formal teaching has commenced .FindingsThe study confirms findings from previous studies and demonstrates that students from both institutions recorded higher than normal levels of EI. However, there were several differences between the student responses from the two institutions and these are discussed later in the paper.Contribution This study explores the EI of students during the university induction period in the moment prior to starting their formal HE studies. This period of undergraduate study has been relatively ignored in the wider field of EI and can help shed light on the shifting aspirations of students as they progress through HEI.",

Given that these can get in the way of even the best intentions, Essential Personal Finance tackles these biases head-on with practical ideas and tips for overcoming or harnessing them for good, and will help you to develop a positive and fruitful relationship with your money. With financial stress being a major cause of absenteeism and sick leave, low morale and lost productivity, the advice in this book also offers employers enormous benefits.

The impact of the share of employees with higher education, provision of on-the-job training, years of experience of the top manager and labour cost on export intensity is assessed. To test these relationships, Tobit and Fractional Logit approaches are adopted. The estimation results suggest that, overall, having a more educated workforce exerts a positive impact on the export intensity of firms in transition economies, the magnitude being larger for CEECs. Average labour cost, as an alternative measure, also turns out to exert a positive but stronger impact. Insufficient evidence is found of a role for training programmes and years of experience of the top manager. ",

Although integration is far from easy (it is no coincidence that it has not happened yet) this model takes into account all the practical needs of the stakeholders involved in the process: accountants, chartered accountants, auditors, governments, public and fiscal authorities, shareholders, creditors, data analysts. This novel approach can seriously offer a breakthrough to accounting and finance big data management [2][3]. This represents an effective method to solve various challenges such as tax evasion, tax avoidance, money laundering, accounting errors, high data storage costs, high audit risks, difficult and unreliable reconciliations, data collection and data analysis, lack of comparability between financial statement of companies based in different countries [4][5].",

We introduce a new game called the prevention and recovery game to study this trade-off. We report results from the experimental lab that allow us to categorize different approaches to risk taking. We show that many individuals appear relatively risk loving in that they invest in recovery rather than prevention. We find little difference in behavior between a gain and loss framing.",

        "abstract": "We investigate how Islamic banking alters the paradigm of the banking system, affecting the loan performance, cost efficiency, and corporate earnings of Islamic banks. The conceptual analysis shows how Islamic banking helps to improve the quality of bank assets by instituting a partnership or non-partnership contract in the banking business on the one hand, and escalates the cost of banking operations on the other side due to the additional operational hurdles, which triggers higher earnings uncertainty in Islamic banking than in conventional banking. The global evidence from 23 countries confirms that, due to the high operational costs, the earnings of Islamic banks are more uncertain even though they perform well in loan operations. Therefore, we conclude Islamic banking trades-off between the reduction of credit risk and escalation of business risk.         ",

In a Cournot model where homogeneous producers observe a public signal about an uncertain cost of production prior to taking quantity decisions, we show that the majoritarian preference of consumers for the precision of public information is fairly well behaved so that a Condorcet winner always exists. Under a monotonicity condition on the demand function, we characterize the Condorcet-winning precision in terms of the demand function and the number of firms under which the Condorcet-winning precision (i) hurts consumers' surplus and profits or (ii) remains conflict-free.

        "abstract": "Previous studies of decomposition of factor inputs have limited their analysis on the estimation of substitution and output effects. However, this paper develops a two-step approach to estimate the substitution and output effects of changes in energy demand resulting from changes in prices and further examines the implications of these effects on CO\n              2 emissions using European industrial dataset over the period 1995\u20132007. In our empirical estimations, instead of relying only on iSUR model like previous studies, we introduced a multilevel model, which is a more befitting model to our data. Our analysis covers industry as a whole and for different sector types. The primary results emerged from our analysis suggest a strong evidence using the multilevel model. Generally, our results show that production inputs are substitutable. We find the substitution and output effects to be negatively related to CO\n              2 emissions, however, the substitution effects dominate. From policy perspectives, our results suggest that output adjustments may not play a significant role in reducing emissions. We find the overall effects of changes in energy demand to be moderate. Then, we argue that increment in energy taxes should be complemented by cleaner factor substitution and sustainable growth to achieve a desirable carbon reduction.\n            ",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on acquiring company systematic risk using a global sample of 34,221 completed deals that occurred between the years 1977 and 2012, covering 163 countries and 85 industries. Design/methodology/approach: Acquirers\u2019 systematic risk (beta) is calculated using the capital asset pricing model. The change in acquirers\u2019 beta post-merger is obtained using event study and tested for mean differences across various sub-categories of deals. Cross-sectional regressions are then performed to test several hypotheses relating to the impact of diversification, method of payment, target status and prior experience on acquirers\u2019 risk. Findings: For the overall sample, the evidence suggests that acquirers\u2019 beta tends to increase post-merger, but only in cases where their pre-merger risk is relatively low in relation to the risk of the market. The authors also show that cash payment deals for publicly listed targets contribute to reducing acquirers\u2019 risk while stock payment increase risk. Diversification, whether global or across industry, has no significant impact on risk. On the other hand, for serial acquirers, the risk is increased significantly with more M&As. Originality/value: This study contributes in a unique way by providing global evidence on acquirers\u2019 systematic risk using a very large and diverse sample of M&A deals and investigating not only the impact of diversification on risk but also of other deal characteristics (e.g. method of payment, target status, acquirers\u2019 prior experience) which have not been previously examined.",

Furthermore, investigate how and why the political change, and its consequences, influence the metrics of updateability of Web CSR & sustainability disclosure in that country with special regard on the contrasts between foreign and local ownerships. Research method: around 2000 CSR data records, related to the period from 2008 to 2015, have been collected by accessing more 6000 web pages on websites of 13 major oil companies working Libya. These data have been uniquely analysed to assess commensurably the awareness and significance of CSR & sustainability disclosure in the studied firms.

It utilises a sample of financial firms listed in the European Economic Area and Switzerland between 2005 and 2016 to make inferences about the impact of the financial crisis on the above-mentioned relationship. The paper also assesses the extent to which the relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns during the financial crisis varies with ownership concentration. We find evidence that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns is significantly more apparent during the financial crisis. This suggests that investors place more emphasis on the unrecognised intangible features of SOBC contracts during the crisis, even though their associated expenses are subject to managerial discretion and measurement errors. We also find that the positive relationship between SOBC expense and shareholder returns over the financial crisis is more pronounced when ownership is more concentrated. The results of our study are robust after controlling for firm size, potential investment growth opportunities, traditional banking activities and firm self-selection bias. ",

Islamic financial market\u2019s (IFM) instruments use different stress testing and liquidity risk approaches due to considerations relating to their regional, regulatory, legal, product and operational requirements that may dictate a certain approach and stress scenarios to manage the associated risks and test their ability to absorb market shocks. This chapter provides in-depth insights into the best market practices for stress testing framework for the survival of Islamic financial markets and institutions in the face of possible market shocks, within a sophisticated financial market in Europe. This subject is important for two reasons: firstly, the survival of an Islamic financial market and its institutions is hugely dependent on its risk factors and stress testing management approaches. Secondly, the ability of managing such market shocks without compromising Shari\u2019ah requirements is a very important component for Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). The study collects its data by using the method of a case study to obtain in-depth knowledge from the Bank of England and IFIs in the UK. The findings of the study identify key stress testing steps and assessment in addition to risks that are crucial for the survival of the IFM and its institutions. It also suggests a stress testing approach that could reduce the impact of financial shocks to the IFM and ensure its resilience.",

It does this by interrogating the underlying assumptions that transparency in the form of increased information disclosure inevitably leads to enhanced accountability and reduced corruption. Theoretic insights are drawn from the transparency literature as well as from the International Accounting Standards Board's framework for financial reporting. The findings enable a more nuanced understanding of transparency \u2013 where and when transparency works, and where and when it may lead to unintended outcomes. They show how increased information disclosure conceals and legitimises the weak and corrupt reporting systems and practices of government agencies. They highlight the importance of understandability of information disclosed as a key requirement of transparency. They illustrate that transparency is a complex social process by highlighting the means by which the government tries to gain control of the NEITI organisation and how NEITI's ability to operate effectively is dependent on the political will of the government in power. The findings also demonstrate that the instrument through which transparency is enacted is itself a central actor in the transparency process as historical corruption within the NEITI bureaucracy as well as the opacity of NEITI as an organisation lead to outcomes of distrust, uncertainty and doubt amongst NEITIs target audience.",

As China rapidly emerges as one of the largest exporters as well as importers, an understanding of Chinese CSR practices is increasingly important not only to Chinese authorities and firms, but also to international stakeholders. However, Chinese CSR has been largely underestimated in previous studies, and this CSR\u2013EM relationship has never been sufficiently examined with regard to Chinese firms. In addition, this study measures the level of EM using two different methods: accrual\u2010based EM (AEM) and real activity\u2010based EM (REM). In general, REM is regarded as more costly but less detectable, while AEM is regarded as less costly but more detectable, owing to the fact that AEM is subject to greater scrutiny from auditors and regulators. The results show that Chinese firms\u2019 enhanced CSR generally decreases their EM practices. On the contrary, state\u2010controlled firms and firms operating in more institutionally developed regions are more likely to engage in REM, while increasing their CSR activities. These findings provide new evidence that managers in Chinese firms tend to opportunistically adopt CSR practices according to the firm's institutional environment.",

Under this, researchers have adopted various social theories to offer alternative explanations for the emerge of different management accounting practice other than environmental pressure or technical demands. However, transfer pricing research remains to be positivistic \u2013 holding neo-classical economic assumptions, and recognising transfer pricing as a contingent practice  (E.g.

        "abstract": "We provide new empirical evidence on the relationship between inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and total factor productivity (TFP) growth using cross-country data for 51 developing countries over the period 1984-2010. Our results suggest a weak direct effect of FDI on TFP growth but, after accounting for the roles of human capital and institutions as contingencies in the FDI-TFP growth relationship, we find a robust FDI-induced productivity growth response dependent on these \u2018absorptive capacities\u2019. However, the relevance of the human capital contingency effect diminishes when the effect of institutions is also considered, which suggests that improving institutions is relatively more important than human capital development for developing countries to realise productivity gains from FDI.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between trade intensity and three stock market phenomena: asymmetric volatility, spillovers and asymmetric spillovers between the US and 74 international stock markets. The evidence is provided based on the cross-market models using the various measures from multivariate volatility models and the spillover indices. As stock trading gets more intensive, the market volatility responds proportionally stronger to a negative domestic shock than a positive one. Trade intensity also increases the spillovers of US shocks to the local markets. However, its impact diminishes at a higher level. Regarding other market characteristics, geographical distance, representing transaction costs or psychological /cultural obstacles, has a significant negative association with spillovers and the asymmetric spillovers. Less negative skewness, as stronger short-selling constraints, is associated with weaker spillovers. More volatile markets are generally linked to stronger asymmetries and spillovers.",

Openness is measured in terms of trade and financial globalization whereas ICT is proxied with mobile phone and internet penetration rates. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The main findings are First, financial openness has an edge over trade openness when combined with ICT to affect both economic and institutional governance. Second, mobile phones have an edge over internet penetration in complementing (i) trade openness for economic governance and (ii) financial openness for institutional governance. Third, net effects on political governance are consistently negative. Taken together, in the short-run, openness-driven ICT policies are more rewarding in terms of economic and institutional governance than political governance. Fourth, catch-up in governance is facilitated by the interaction between openness and ICT. Contributions of these findings to literature are discussed.",

In this article, we review and develop the game theoretic literature on kidnapping in order to gain insight on ransomware. The prior literature on kidnapping has largely focused on political or terrorist hostage taking. We demonstrate, however, that key models within the literature can be adapted to give critical new insight on ransomware. We primarily focus on two models. The first gives insight on the optimal ransom that criminals should charge. The second gives insight on the role of deterrence through preventative measures. A key insight from both models will be the importance of spillover effects across victims. We will argue that such spillovers point to the need for some level of outside intervention, by governments or otherwise, to tackle ransomware.",

        "abstract": "Applicability to the Conference Theme\n\nThis paper explores the university as part of the ecosystem of business support for MSMEs in the West Midlands. While the concept of \u2018space\u2019 is open to interpretation, in the context of this study it is viewed from two perspective: firstly, the individual entrepreneurial universities as discrete spaces and secondly, the regional context of the West Midland as an overall shared space inhabited by MSMEs. The distances between these spaces is often mediate through various policy initiatives, which aim to create economic sustainability (Marrewijk 2003, Pojasek 2007, Samujh 2011) and growth in the region through its MSMEs (Martins & Mawson 1980, Gibbs 2000, Lundstrum et al 2014). This research explores the effectiveness and impact of policy as a mechanism for mediation and the viability of policy as a mechanism for ongoing sustainability and growth (Ham & Hill 1993, Hart 2003, Huggins & Williams 2009). \n\nAims\n\nThis research aimed to determine if a model of sustainable business support could be developed for MSMEs that is not dependent on \u2018public\u2019 funding as a keystone. This paper examines the national and regional business support agenda; the support needs of MSMEs; the role of universities (or HEIs) in the provision of business support, and the needs of public funding bodies with regards to economic sustainability and growth of MSMEs in the West Midlands.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis interpretivist study utilises semi-structured interviews with key post holders from West Midland\u2019s universities. Four universities were identified for participation in the study. They were selected to achieve a representative mixture of university classifications and geographical spread across the region. Individual participants were a representative blend of leaders (Vice of Deputy Vice Chancellor), senior managers (Pro-Vice Chancellor) and managers. The aim was to conduct sixteen interviews, (comprised of four per institution), however an unobjectionable minimum of two was considered acceptable. In addition, secondary data was drawn from publicly available reports, publications and the institutions\u2019 websites.   Through this understanding, the research produced a series of outcomes and identifiable trends, which in turn facilitated the creation of the conceptual model for business support, which is focus of this paper. \n\nContribution\n\nThe research demonstrates that funding is a \u2018keystone\u2019 of the support system across the region and it proposes a range of options to support providers, governments and the MSME community in order to address and re-balance the current in-balance in funding provision. It highlighted systemic challenges within the tripartite relationship between Business, Universities, and Governments (also referred to as the triple helix). A key finding is noticeably lack of underpinning research by the support providers themselves who tended to focus only on data that supported their bids. There is a lack of flexibility in public funding to address the bespoke needs for the MSME owners (see also Devins et al 2005).  There is a lack of dedicated, long term, enterprise strategy within the HEIs to ensure sustainability, rather there is a short term focus on policy and economic stimulus interventions which result in fragmented support.",

        "abstract": "At the 58th World Health Assembly in 2005, world leaders committed to attaining universal health coverage (UHC) for their populations. Henceforth goal 3.8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals defines the priority areas to achieve UHC goals \u2013 equity in the use of health services, quality of care and financial protection, by 2030. Consequently, the key functions of a health financing system \u2013 revenue raising, pooling and purchasing, are at the core of a country\u2019s progress towards achieving UHC. The World Health Organisation has argued that in order to provide access to good quality health care services for all members of the population, the health financing system should avoid catastrophic health expenditure caused by large out-of-pocket payments and user fees; they dampen demand and create barriers to access especially for the poor. Typically, in Uganda, domestic private health expenditure is the dominant source of health sector financing contributing more than 50% of the total current health expenditure, with 40% as household out-of-pocket payments. We employed an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate the relationship between health care financing sources and health outcomes using a health access and quality index as a proxy for health outcome. In our analysis, we posited that preventable (treatable) causes of death are a good measure of access to healthcare and quality of healthcare in the health system. We constructed a healthcare access and quality index based on three health indicators: Under-five mortality, DPT3 coverage, and Immunization against measles in Uganda, using the principal component analysis method. The index ranges between 0 and 100 whereby moving towards 100 signifies increasing level of health care access and quality. The study finds that an increase in the ratio of private to government health care financing has different impacts in the short run and long run. While in the short-run it increases access and quality of health care, in the long run it reduces access and quality of health care.  The findings suggest that reliance on private health care financing is not sustainable in the long run, if the country is to achieve the universal health coverage goals by 2030. Therefore, government ought to increase its share of health care financing to avoid the negative impact of relying on private health care financing in the long run.",

In particular, it explores (1) how common financial reporting fraud is in Egypt, (2) the perpetrators and victims of financial reporting fraud in Egypt and (3) how financial reporting fraud is committed and concealed in Egypt. The study sheds light on generic issues that could have implications for auditors and audit regulators. In addition, the study provides a detailed guide on how financial reporting fraud schemes are committed and concealed in Egypt, knowledge of which could help auditors design effective audit tests to assess fraud risk and help those charged with governance to design effective prevention and detection techniques. Egypt could be an attractive destination for international investors, therefore knowledge of the nature and victims of fraud in Egypt could help investors make informed decisions about where to invest their money. The results of this study could also help regulators in Egypt as well as World Trade Organizations determine where to focus their support and enforcement efforts.",

        "abstract": "Accounting is an integral part of the financial and economic activity of economic entities, regardless of the type of activity and industry in which the enterprise operates. This paper summarizes the arguments and counterarguments in the scientific discussion regarding the nature of accounts in accounting practice. Thepurpose of the study is to deepen the analysis of European financial accounting practices, in particular in the context of the use of methodological support for the classification of the nature of accounts. Particular emphasis is placed on the evolution of accounting practices: an analysis of the major evolutionary stagesthat have occurred in different historical periods in accordance with the social needs of society and the economic and financial consequences of such transformational changes. The systematization of literary sources on the subject made it possible to identify three key stages of the evolutionary development ofaccounting and the essential nature of accounts, in particular: 1) the prerequisites for the emergence of financial and accounting, confirmed by a written accounting record dated 1494; 2) implementation of business continuity accounting based on the use of adjusting records and in-depth study of the nature and nature of accounts; 3) substantiation of the practical implementation of the triple record based on the implementation of blockchain technology. Based on the theoretical studies, the author substantiates the need to use in accounting practice a three-dimensional method of accounting by economic entities, which will more accurately reflect the financial transactions carried out by the company and avoid possible economic mistakes. The study postulates the need to integrate the third book within the accounting system.Summarizing, the author substantiates the need to develop in the future convergent methods of balancing the dual accounting system and maintaining accounts with the third book.

Practices, associations of individuals with a preference set shared by its members, provide context and unify preferences across an economy so that decision-makers are situated in social and economic structures. Our framework models the time evolution of certain attributes, emerging from the practice framework, that govern individuals\u2019 decisions and their intertemporal variation. A novel feature is that preferences are able to rank other preference sets without the need to aggregate them. Instead, the selection of a preference set is treated as a decision in its own right.

Our results show that smaller board size and the presence of audit and remuneration committees decrease agency costs. We also find that higher managerial and institutional ownership reduces agency costs. However, duality and the proportion of non-executive directors on the board have no effect on agency costs, suggesting that not all board structure governance mechanisms are effective in mitigating agency costs.  Interestingly, the non-board structure code recommendations such as improved shareholder voting rights, the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and auditor quality have also reduced agency costs. Overall, we find that the introduction of the Ghanaian Code played significant role in reducing agency costs.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - This study investigates how bank size affects the role of information asymmetry on financial access in a panel of 162 banks in 39 African countries for the period 2001-2011.  Design/methodology/approach - The empirical evidence is based on instrumental variable Fixed Effects regressions with overlapping and non-overlapping bank size thresholds to control for the QLH (Quiet Life Hypothesis). The QLH postulates that managers of large banks will use their privileges for private gains at the expense of making financial services more accessible to the general public. Financial access is measured with loan price and loan quantity whereas information asymmetry is implicit in the activities of public credit registries and private credit bureaus.  Findings - The findings with non-overlapping thresholds are broadly consistent with those that are conditional on overlapping thresholds. First, public credit registries have a decreasing effect on the price of loans with the magnitude of reduction comparable across all bank size thresholds. Second, both public credit registries and private credit bureaus enhance the quantity of loans. Third, compared with public credit registries,  private credit bureaus have a greater influence in increasing financial access because they have a significantly higher  favourable effect on the quantity  and price of loans Fourth, the QLH is not apparent because large banks are not associated with lower levels of financial access compared to small banks. Originality/value - Studies of public credit registries and private credit bureaus in Africa are sparse. This is one of the few to assess linkages between bank size, information asymmetry and financial access. ",

        "publication title": "Comparative compliance status of AAOIFI and IFSB standards: An empirical evidence from Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited",
        "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 This paper aims to examine the compliance status of Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) Financial Accounting Standards-1 and Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) Standard-4 by Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL), recognizing the regulatory influence for complying with AAOIFI and IFSB standards and identifying the factors influencing the compliance with these standards.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The present study used content analysis approach for investigating the compliance status. The study considered IBBL as the only sample because it is the only Islamic bank in Bangladesh which is the member of both AAOIFI and IFSB. Hence, this paper investigated the compliancestatus of IBBL as a member of AAOIFI and IFSB. The study examined the annual reports of 2008-2012 as these were the latest and contemporary reports in 2013 when the study was conducted. SPSS software version 22.0 was used to analyze the data. A total of 203 items under 13 categories of AAOIFI standard and 133 items under 17 categories of IFSB standard were considered. Ordinary least squares was run to test the hypotheses of the study.Findings \u2013 The study found that IBBL on an average complied 46.31 per cent of AAOIFI and 52.50 per cent of IFSB standards during the period, and importantly, IBBL did not comply some of the categories of required disclosures. The study also observed that size, as measured by total asset and number of branches, has a significant influence on compliance with IFSB standard, but not AAOIFI. The findings of the study depicted that IBBL did not reasonably recognize the importance of complying with AAOIFI and IFSB standards. Poor compliance or non-compliance with AAOIFI and IFSB accounting and reporting standards by IBBL exposed that the bank is not efficient in managing Shari`ah compliance risks, operational risks and transparent financial reporting. Therefore, recognition of the Shari`ah standards by the respective IFIs and a \u201cregulatorypush\u201d is vital for improving the level of compliance with these standards.Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study considered IBBL as the only sample of the study because it is the only Islamic bank in Bangladesh which holds the membership of both AAOIFI and IFSB. The fiscal years 2008-2012 only were selected to evaluate the compliance status of the AAOIFI and IFSB standards in preparation and presentation of the financial statements of IBBL for comparative analysis because IFSB standard for accounting and disclosure was formulated in 2007; hence, the study could not evaluate the compliance status before 2008.Practical implications \u2013 The study will help IBBL in identifying their limitations in complying AAOIFI and IFSB standards and also the regulators in designing the accounting and reporting frameworks in regulating Islamic banks in Bangladesh. The study would help IBBL in identifying the reasons for noncompliance,how improvement in compliance level may help the bank in mitigating Shari`ah compliance and operational risk and how new legal and institutional framework may improve the level of compliance with those standards.Social implications \u2013 The study observed that the AAOIFI and IFSB standards were set for increasing the level of Shari`ah compliance, but the compliance status showed that different classes of accounting and reporting were ignored from compliance by IBBL. This study will benefit the stakeholders in choosing aShari`ah-compliant bank.Originality/value \u2013 This is a unique study which considered both AAOIFI and IFSB accounting and reporting standards in evaluating the reporting compliance status of an Islamic bank and identified the influence of reporting compliance on managing Shari`ah compliance risks, operational risks and transparency. This study expects to instigate the Islamic banks in complying accounting and reporting standards for being Shari`ah-compliant.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: We assess the correlations between mobile banking and inclusive development (poverty and inequality) in 93 developing countries for the year 2011. Design/methodology/approachMobile banking entails: \u2018mobile phones used to pay bills\u2019 and \u2018mobile phones used to receive/send money\u2019, while the modifying policy indicator is the human development index (HDI). The data is decomposed into seven sub-panels based on two fundamental characteristics: (i) regions (Latin America, Asia and the Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, and Middle East and North Africa) and (ii) income levels (upper middle income, lower middle income and low income).FindingsOur results show that at certain thresholds of the HDI, mobile banking is positively linked to inclusive development. The following specific findings are established. First, the increased use of mobile phones to pay bills is negatively correlated with: (i) poverty in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), upper-middle-income countries (UMIC) and Latin American countries (LA) respectively at HDI thresholds of 0.725, 0.727 and 0.778 and (ii) inequality in UMIC and LA with HDI thresholds of respectively 0.646 and 0.761. Second, the increased use of mobile phones to send/receive money is negatively correlated with: (i) poverty in LMIC, UMIC and Central and Eastern European countries (CEE) with corresponding HDI thresholds of 0.631, 0.750 and 0.750 and (ii) inequality in UMIC, CEE and LA at HDI thresholds of 0.665, 0.736 and 0.726 respectively. Practical implicationsThe findings are discussed in the light of current policy challenges in the transition from the UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development Goals.Originality/value We have exploited the only macroeconomic data on mobile banking currently available",

        "publication title": "Competing Institutional Logics in Islamic Financial Reporting Standardisation: A Comparative Study ",
        "abstract": "Recognising the accounting implications of Islamic business principles, initiatives have been taken to develop a framework that primarily aims to serve the financial reporting needs of Islamic financial industry. Those initiatives started with the objective of developing separate Islamic accounting standards. However, they have ended up with significantly heterogeneous objectives. Employing Institutional Logics Perspective (ILP) as a theoretical framework and case-study approach as a research design, this study provides comparative accounts into the role of selected institutional logics (religion, profession, market, community and state) in shaping two Islamic financial reporting standardisation projects initiated by the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the Malaysian Accounting Standard Board (MASB). Moreover, utilising ILP supplemented by remarks from the institutional entrepreneurship concept, this study examines the role of actors in initiating and then differently shaping the standardisation policies of these projects. Research findings informed by semi-structured interviews and document analysis indicate that Islamic financial reporting standardisation projects have been historically mapped by certain institutional logics. The dominance of those logics has experienced significant changes over time, resulting in subsequent changes in the standardisation strategies of those projects. Influential actors have also played an important role in shaping those projects through promoting certain organisational strategies in line with the institutional logics in which they are embedded This study concludes that the heterogeneity which AAOFI and MASB have shown in their standardisation strategies is attributed to: the relative dominance of certain logics in each institutional context; the centrality of those logics to organisational mission and goals; the extent to which prevailing institutional logics are represented within the organisation and the balance of power between different logics' representatives; and the extent to which actors have been able to promote their entrepreneurial vision and mobilise allies behind it.",

        "abstract": "Although meeting the recommendations of corporate governance code is important, it is not sufficient to ensure the governance effectiveness (often having more form than substance). This, alongside with the fact that the Jordanian corporate governance code is still in its infancy, motivates the study to look beyond the current code recommendations. For this purpose, this study seeks views of key practitioners regarding possible additions/changes to the current code that they feel are important in promoting audit quality. Questionnaire survey is used to obtain views of the auditors, boards of directors and audit committees\u2019 members of the Jordanian listed companies. A number of important recommendations have been put forward by the respondents. The study has an implication for policymakers by providing useful inputs for future governance reform. Also, the study provides insights to companies that are interested in corporate governance quality. The important information gained from the key respondents no doubt contributes to the literature and also opens new avenues for future research. This study offers an important contribution by extending the investigation of boards of directors\u2019 and audit committees\u2019 roles in promoting audit quality to dimensions that are not recommended in the current governance code, and also widely neglected in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Despite the evolving literature on the development benefits of mobile phones, we still know very little about factors that influence their adoption. Using twenty five policy variables, we investigate determinants of mobile phone penetration in 49 Sub-Saharan African countries with data for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary OLS, Fixed effects, System GMM and Quantile regression techniques. The determinants are classified into six policy categories. They are: (i) macroeconomic, (ii) business/bank, (iii) market-related, (iv) knowledge economy, (v) external flows and (vi) human development. Results are presented in terms of threshold and non-threshold effects. The former has three main implications. First, there are increasing positive benefits in regulation quality, human development, foreign investment, education, urban population density and internet penetration. Second, there is evidence of decreasing positive effects from patent applications. Third, increasing damaging influences are established for foreign aid and return on equity. Non-threshold tendencies are discussed. Policy implications are also covered with emphasis on policy syndromes to enhance more targeted implications for worst performing nations.",

Empirical findings suggest that survival (failure) probability increases (decreases) with increasing firm size and firms in different size categories have varying determinants of bankruptcy, whereas factors affecting their financial distress are mostly invariant. Magnitude of significant covariates changes across the size categories of both bankrupt and financially distressed firms. Further, operating cash flow information does not add any marginal increment in prediction performance of multivariate hazard models above baseline models developed using information from income statements and balance sheets.

The meta-analysis reveals that terrorist attacks have almost no impact on stock markets and only marginal effect on foreign exchange markets, though effects vary with individual attacks and markets. The number of fatalities slightly raises the likelihood of adverse impact, while the number of wounded and the magnitude of recent attacks slightly decrease it. The markets are hit less hard when attack-day returns are positive, but variance is more likely to increase in the short term. Also, the impact of an attack is stronger when the market is performing extremely well or poorly.",

        "abstract": "The paper investigates the effects of information asymmetry (between the realised return and the expected return) on market timing in the mutual fund industry. For the purpose, we use a panel of 1488 active open-end mutual funds for the period 2004-2013. We use fund-specific time-dynamic betas. Information asymmetry is measured as the standard deviation of idiosyncratic risk. The dataset is decomposed into five market fundamentals in order to emphasis the policy implications of our findings with respect to (i) equity, (ii) fixed income, (iii) allocation, (iv) alternative and (v) tax preferred mutual funds. The empirical evidence is based on endogeneity-robust Difference and System Generalised Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, information asymmetry broadly follows the same trend as volatility, with a higher sensitivity to market risk exposure. Second, fund managers tend to raise (cutback) their risk exposure in time of high (low) market liquidity. Third, there is evidence of convergence in equity funds. We may therefore infer that equity funds with lower market risk exposure are catching-up with their counterparts with higher exposure to fluctuation in market conditions. The paper complements the scarce literature on market timing in the mutual fund industry with time-dynamic betas, information asymmetry and an endogeneity-robust empirical approach.  ",

        "abstract": "Aim This article offers nurse managers guidance on analysing, managing and addressing a potentially dissatisfied nursing workforce, focusing on three priority shortage specialties: emergency care, paediatrics and cardiology. The aim of the study was to explore to what extent registered nurses and healthcare assistants, referred to collectively here as \u2018nursing staff\u2019, are satisfied with teamworking opportunities, continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities and workplace autonomy.Method A survey questionnaire was developed to evaluate three derived determinants of nurse satisfaction: team working, CPD and autonomy. The NHS West Midlands region was the focus given that it is among the poorest performing regions outside London in filling nursing posts.Findings Overall, nursing staff respondents were satisfied with teamworking, CPD and autonomy, which challenges the perception that nurses in NHS England are dissatisfied with these satisfaction determinants. The findings give a complex picture of nurse satisfaction; for example a large minority of respondents were dissatisfied with their ability to carry out duties as they see fit.Conclusion When developing management systems to investigate, manage and enhance nurse satisfaction, nurse managers must recognise the complexity and subtleties of determining factors. This will increase as nursing becomes more specialised. Subsequently, nurse managers need to work closely with staff at higher education institutions and other professional agencies to commission appropriate professional development.",

The concept of international competitiveness (in relation to environmental regulation) is assessed in two broad schools of thought: neoclassical economics and the competitiveness school to which the Porter Hypothesis belongs. We identify the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) as the least common denominator for empirical evaluation of the main themes of these two competing schools of thought. As a minimum, one would need to find evidence on PHH to question the validity of the Porter Hypothesis. A fully legitimate test of the Porter Hypothesis should, inter alia, have a particular emphasis on the impact of well-designed environmental policies on high-value sectors of an economy. Examining the recent empirical literature on the PHH we find that the evidence remains inconclusive. This leaves the Porter Hypothesis largely unscathed and challenges the widely-held view of the existence of a trade-off between economic performance and environmental quality.",

The empirical evidence is based on 78 developing countries for the period 1984\u20132008. Domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism variables are used. Absolute (or unconditional) and conditional catch-ups are estimated using Generalised Method of Moments. We establish consistently that, the rate of catch-up is higher in domestic terrorism relative to transnational terrorism. The time to full catch-up required for the implementation of common policies without distinction of nationality is found to be in a horizon of 13\u201320 years for domestic terrorism and 24\u201328 years for transnational terrorism. Hence, from a projection date of 2009, in spite of decreasing cross-country differences in terrorists\u2019 attacks, there is still a long way to go before feasible common policy initiatives can be fully implemented without distinction of nationality.

Using structural equation modelling, the article employs 4503 European banks data from 2001 to 2005 examining the interaction of tier 1 capital and financial performance. The results indicate that the banks have grown post the 2008 financial crisis. Likewise, the tier 1 has increased but the increase is not in line with the expansion. As expected there is a negative association between tier 1 capital and financial performance. The results also indicate that the banks have diversified their revenue streams compared with pre-2008. In terms of efficiency, the results indicate that the cost income ratio post 2008 is higher than pre-financial crisis. The results imply that the regulators must take account of the expansion of banks and the increase in their capital levels.",

        "abstract": "In the light of evidence that poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa, where about 45% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa did not achieve the Millennium development goal extreme poverty target, this study assesses whether increasing foreign aid improves inclusive human development. The investigation is on 53 African countries for the period 2005\u20132012. The empirical analysis is based on (1) the generalised method of moments (GMM) to control for persistence in inclusive human development, simultaneity and time-invariant omitted variables and (2) Instrumental Variable Tobit Regressions to control for simultaneity and the limited range in the dependent variable. The adopted foreign aid variables are: \u2018humanitarian assistance\u2019, \u2018action on debt\u2019 \u2018aid for social infrastructure\u2019, \u2018aid to the productive sector\u2019, \u2018aid to the multi sector\u2019, \u2018aid for economic infrastructure\u2019 and \u2018programme assistance\u2019. The following findings are established. From the GMM specifications, there are (1) synergy effects from \u2018aid to the productive sector\u2019 and a positive net effect from \u2018programme assistance\u2019 and (2) negative net impacts from \u2018aid to social infrastructure\u2019 and human assistance, albeit with positive marginal effects. From Instrumental Variable Tobit regressions (1) there is a synergy effect from \u2018aid for economic infrastructure\u2019 and (2) there are negative net impacts from \u2018aid for social infrastructure\u2019, \u2018aid to the productive sector\u2019 and human assistance, albeit with positive marginal effects.

First, from the Generalised Method of Moments results, a mobile phone penetration rate of 54.29, rising to 57 per 100 people are predicted to neutralise the adverse effect of market power on the average loan price and quantity respectively. Second, from the Quantile Regressions, mobile phone penetration rates of 56.20, 52.04 and 42.76 per 100 people is needed to nullify the negative effect of market power on loan quantity at the 10th decile, 25th quartile and 90th decile respectively. Third, a considerably lower internet penetration rate of 9.49 per 100 people is required to counteract the negative impact of market power on loan quantity at the 90th decile.

Most importantly, it is established that even in economies with a continuum of small agents and infinitely many atoms (all of whom can arbitrage prices if they so wish), and an infinite number of markets per commodity, the set of equilibria\u2014and the resulting market structure\u2014is influenced, both by strategic behaviour, and private ownership of posts.",

        "abstract": "Today, the West faces a considerable dilemma in their support for the Washington Consensus as a dominant approach for development because the Beijing model has grown to become an unavoidable process which can only be neglected at the cost of standing on the wrong side of economic history. The Washington Consensus, the hitherto dominant scheme, is being encroached on by the Beijing model. Many African nations are increasingly embracing this later method because the prevailing Western model has failed to deliver on a number of objectives. This is increasingly evident because China\u2019s economic diplomacy has been politely and strategically coined to achieve it.  A case study is used herein to articulate the different strands of the survey. The paper puts some structure on China\u2019s economic diplomatic strategies and discusses lessons for Africa, China and the West. It contributes to existing literature by critically assessing why it is necessary for the West to modify the conception and definition of the Washington Consensus as a counterpart to the Beijing model. In order to remain relevant in the 21st century and beyond, the Washington Consensus should incorporate those ideas which are in conformity with Moyo\u2019s (2013) conjecture. This postulates that, while the Beijing model is optimal in the short-run, the Washington Consensus remains the ideal long-term development model because it is more inclusive of the rights demanded by individuals at different income categories.

Three broad concepts of governance are explored: (i) political (comprising voice & accountability and political stability/no violence), (ii) economic (involving government effectiveness and regulation quality) and (iii) institutional (including corruption-control and rule of law). Ten dimensions of entrepreneurship are considered. Two main findings are established with respect to the net effects of the interaction between mobile phones and governance dynamics. They are (1) reduced cost of business start-up procedure, the time to build a warehouse and the time to resolve an insolvency and (2) increased time to enforce a contract, to register a property and to prepare and pay taxes. Implications for theory and policy are discussed. Some of the engaged policy implications include the following. (i) Measures on how to leverage on the potential of mobile phone penetration for entrepreneurship opportunities by addressing challenge of access to and affordability of mobile phones on the one hand and on the other hand, improving on the role of the mobile phone as a participative interface between emerging entrepreneurs and governance. (ii) The relevance of the mobile phone in mitigating information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and government institutions, notably by: reducing government inefficiency (which potentially represents an additional cost to doing business) and decreasing informational rents, bureaucracy and transaction costs.",

ICT is proxied with internet and mobile phone penetration rates whereas openness is measured in terms of financial and trade globalisation. Ten indicators of doing business are used, namely: cost of business start-up procedures; procedure to enforce a contract; start-up procedures to register a business; time required to build a warehouse; time required to enforce a contract; time required to register a property; time required to start a business; time to export; time to prepare and pay taxes; and time to resolve an insolvency. The empirical evidence is based on generalised method of moments with forward orthogonal deviations.FindingsWhile the authors find substantial evidence that ICT complements openness to improve conditions for entrepreneurship, the effects are contingent on the dynamics of openness, ICT and entrepreneurship. Theoretical and practical policy implications are discussed.Originality/valueThe inquiry is based on two contemporary development concerns: the need for policy to leverage on the ICT penetration potential in the sub-region and the relevance of entrepreneurship in addressing associated issues of population growth such as unemployment.",

This paper presents an argument in favour of PhD by Publication as a tool for innovation and technology transfer. Building on the literature on the key role of a knowledge economy in 21st century development and catch-up processes, we argue that: (i) in order for PhD dissertations to be more useful to society, they should be harmonised with scientific publications which centre on improving the design and quality of existing and new products in developing countries. (ii) Obtaining a doctorate degree should not simply be reduced to a change in candidate\u2019s title as is often the case with a traditional thesis. (iii) The PhD by Publication is a more effective route to ensuring that the contribution to knowledge is widely disseminated. The conceptual framework consists primarily of the clarification of the models of PhD by Publication and the linkages between the doctoral education, innovation, technology transfer and development catch-up.

The estimation technique used is a two-stage least-squares instrumental variable methodology. Political regime channels of democracy, polity and autocracy are instrumented with legal-origins, religious-legacies, income-levels and press-freedom qualities to account for stock market performance dynamics of capitalisation, value traded, turnover and number of listed companies. The findings show that countries with democratic regimes enjoy higher levels of financial market development compared to their counterparts with autocratic inclinations. As a policy implication, the role of sound political institutions has important effects on both the degree of competition for public office and the quality of public offices that favour stock market development on the African continent.",

        "abstract": "The risk associated with lending to small businesses has become more important since regulations started obliging banks to use separate procedures in assessing SMEs' credit worthiness. However, current accounting-based models for SMEs do not account for the impact of market information on default prediction. We fill this gap in the literature by introducing a hybrid default prediction model for unlisted SMEs that uses market information of listed SMEs (comparable approach) alongside existing accounting information of unlisted SMEs. Our results suggest that the accuracy of this default prediction modelling approach in the hold-out sample, during the period of the financial crisis 2007-09 and for the entire sample-period, improves considerably. We conclude that the proposed hybrid model is a good replacement for existing standard accounting-based methods on SMEs' default prediction.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role colonial ties play in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ghana, several years after the official end of colonisation in the African continent. Colonisation left behind legacies of institutional framework, social ties and remnants of companies of colonial masters, which could potentially offer contemporary businesses from home countries the benefits of country of origin agglomeration. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses sequential explanatory mixed research design through 101 questionnaires and 8 interviews from the UK companies with FDI in Ghana. This approached enabled the initial quantitative results to be explored further through the qualitative data. Findings: Colonial ties have limited influence on contemporary flow of FDI to Ghana, in spite of the institutional legacies between former colonisers and colonies. Majority of UK companies are influenced by agglomeration opportunities in general rather than country of origin agglomeration. However, country of origin agglomeration remains important to over a third of the companies surveyed. Research limitations/implications: The sample was taken from the non-extractive industry in Ghana, and caution must be applied in generalising the findings. However, some universal issues concerning agglomeration and institutions are discussed. Originality/value: Although there has been some research on colonial history and its impact on FDI in Africa, existing knowledge on bilateral relations is rather limited. Unlike previous studies, this research provides depth by examining colonial influence on FDI between two countries, using two key concepts: country of origin agglomeration and institutions. It provides UK companies with contemporary views to consider when exploring FDI opportunities in Ghana, particularly in relation to the effects of the colonial history. It also provides investment promotion agencies with empirical results on the importance of various forms of agglomeration and institutions for FDI attraction.",

This paper revisits the evidence suggesting share-financed acquirers engage in earnings management prior to announcing mergers to know whether the existing evidence indeed suggests the presence of earnings management or it is just the result of measurement errors in the earnings management detection models. This paper shows that the first digits of figures reported in the financial statements of share-financed acquirers prior to the merger announcements are distributed remarkably differently from what are expected under Benford\u2019s Law.

The usefulness of payment banks and other mobile-based money platforms could be traced to the fact that it provides easy access to money, ease money sending difficulties, the speed of sending and receiving money, mobile access, and other usefulness (Cudjoe, A., Anim, P., & Nyan, J., 2015). However, there are certain risks that are associated with payment banks and mobile-based money platforms that most of the previous authors never write upon. This is a research gap observed. This research intended to close the gaps by presenting a complete journal report on not only related to the benefits, but the risks related to the payment banks and mobile-based money platforms. This paper discovered that the risks associated with payment banks and mobile- based money platforms pose a minimal threat and that was the reason why previous authors decided not to mention through its data collection methodology of 400 questionnaires collated from respondents. That is customers will continue to patronize mobile-based money platforms despite its minimal threat.",

After reviewing the backdrop, conundrums and approaches, the chapter outlines a Sustainable Management for Affordable Housing (\u2018SMAH\u2019) framework and investigates developing and developed country contexts. Definitions of affordable housing vary but it must be both cheap and meet minimum standards for human dignity and flourishing. Philosophically, the extent of and mechanism for government intervention to influence markets is contested but, for housing supply, it spans political economy, planning policy and collaborative local schemes, supported by a comprehensive Land Administrative System. However, in emerging cities housing and food security are intricately linked. In developed nations, with relatively sophisticated logistics, contested politics and lack of investment constrain affordable housing delivery. Nowadays, technology is central but no system can ever resolve the inherent tensions between informed excellence, commercial gain and environmental protection. Rather than a final blueprint, the SMAH sparks continuous dialogue, multi-criteria reflection and policy learning.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable development calls for the wise use of groundwater resources. Of particular concern is saline intrusion into productive agricultural land, which is contiguous with densely populated coastal settlements. To reverse saline intrusion in such coastal regions, information about the groundwater depth in terms of its spatio-temporal variability is essential. Using survey data from 2004 to 2007, the research revealed the temporal variation characteristics of groundwater depth in the Contemporary Yellow River Delta. It explored the temporal stability characteristics of groundwater depth by using the coefficient of variation, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and average relative deviation and standard deviation, and confirmed that the representative point reflected the average groundwater depth of the study area. Results showed that spatial variation of the groundwater depth in the study area was medium, but the variation coefficient of groundwater depth showed the seasonal changes. The spatial variation coefficient was largest in the dry season; the other months were relatively stable. The groundwater depth in the study area had strong temporal stability. The correlation between the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and the time lags showed that the spatial pattern of groundwater depth in the study area was similar across two or three years but the similarity weakened beyond this period. The representative points of the whole area showed a good linear correlation, and were spatially concentrated. In different years or time periods, the representative points were not the same but belonged to the medium groundwater depth grade in the area. The study provides useful guidance for Yellow River irrigation, preventing saline intrusion and the restoration of saline-alkali soils. It offers a theoretical basis for identifying regional satellite groundwater depth monitoring points.",

        "abstract": "This study compares the responsiveness of microcredit interest rates with age, scale of lending, and organizational charter. It uses an unbalanced panel of 300 microfinance institutions (MFIs) from 107 developing countries from 2005 to 2015. Three key trends emerge from the results of a 2SLS regression. First, the adoption of formal microbanking practices raises interest rates compared with other forms of microlending. Second, large\u2010scale lending lowers interest rates only for those MFIs that already hold legal banking status. Third, age of operation in excess of 8 years exerts a negative impact on interest rates, regardless of scale and charter type of MFI. Collectively, our results indicate that policies that incentivize mature MFIs to share their knowledge will be more effective in helping the nascent institutions to overcome their cost disadvantages compared with reforms to transform them into licensed banks. For MFIs that already hold permits to operate as banks, initiatives to increase loan sizes are key strategic pricing decisions, irrespective of the institution's age. This study is original in its differentiation of the impact on interest rates of regulations that promote formal banking principles, credit market extension vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis knowledge sharing between mature and nascent MFIs.",

In order to remain competitive relevant in the automobile industries globally, China\u2019s automobile industries had to drive a strategic to channel its automobile production in the right perspective to remain competitive relevant. This led to the launched of a supply chain management by China\u2019s automobile industries. This paper considered the likely positive economic effects of the supply chain management on China\u2019s automobile industries. Firstly, the supply chain tends to open more markets for China\u2019s automotive industries in the ASEAN, EU, and AU regions. Secondly, the supply chain threatens China\u2019s automobile industries control over her local and regional markets from foreign automobile industries as China open their markets  for international automobile industries in order to penetrate into foreign automobile markets. That is the supply chain poses a two-sided coin effect on Chain\u2019s automobile industries.Thirdly, the intention of the China\u2019s automobile industries to developed environmental friendly automobile vehicles (evergreen automobiles) just like their competitors to remain competitive. This paper employed a strategic methodology of comparing the present; China\u2019s automobile industries supply chain management and the intended supply chain management acceptable by the Western\u2019s automobile industries. The sampling of 200 participants of stakeholders that comprised of Western automobile dealers, Western automobile industries representatives, China\u2019s automobile industries representatives, China\u2019s automobile suppliers, EU representatives, and other participants indicated that the posed supply china management has positive economic effects on the China industries.",

        "abstract": "We examine whether armed conflict, international and domestic terrorism affect distribution of bilateral and multilateral foreign aid. We argue that the two types of aid may respond differently to security challenges because of donors\u2019 disparate objectives and aid-giving motives. The results show that armed conflict reduces the amounts of obtained aid of all types, conditional on a country being an aid recipient. Multilateral donors are also less likely to include a conflict-ridden country on a recipient list. Domestic terrorism increases bilateral aid, but this effect appears to be entirely driven by assistance from the United States, arguably a terrorist prime-target country. When we disaggregate aid flows by their purposes, we find that international and domestic terrorism are associated with increases in bilateral aid for promotion of governance, education, health and society.",

        "abstract": "This paper contributes to the literature by extending the interpretation of financial contagion beyond that of the market correlation approach popularised by Forbes and Rigobon (2002). Contagion is explored from the perspective of its impact on the conditional sector-risk Beta of the African Emerging Market natural resources sector. A multi-factor CAPM model is developed within a DCC-MGARCH framework to estimate time-varying Beta. We find that this reacts in different ways to different contagion events. It rose by a statistically significant 0.058 (an 8% increase) in response to the euro-zone crisis. However, with the exception of South Africa, the 2007\u201309 crisis was found to have no significant impact on Beta. We speculate that the differences found can be attributed to the different ways in which individual contagion events impact on individual markets. From this we conclude that \u2018one size fits all\u2019 correlations-based contagion analysis can often hide as much as it reveals.",

        "abstract": "Rapid progress to universal healthcare coverage is dependent on adequate resourcing. In low-income-countries, government health expenditure is below the WHO recommended level for universal health coverage and these countries rely heavily on external resources for healthcare financing which is unsustainable. This paper evaluates three options for creating greater domestic fiscal space to support universal health coverage in a more sustainable manner: prioritising the health sector by increasing the health budget share (given a fixed government budget), an earmarked tax for health and increasing foreign aid for health. We use a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model to capture the lagged health and healthcare effects. We find that increasing the health share in the general government budget generates higher growth rates in GDP, investment and private consumption, and accelerates poverty reduction in Uganda, leading to increased health, strengthening the case for policy-makers in low- and middle-income countries to frontload investment in healthcare.

        "abstract": "This chapter investigates the relative strength of the contributions of tradeopenness and FDI inflows towards economic growth of Thailand, taking accountof the importance of human capital and other conditioning factors as a source oftechnology transfer in facilitating growth. Using Granger causality tests conducted within a vector-error-correction framework, the authors find significant evidence of the complementarities between domestic investment and trade openness, providing support for import-led growth. In contrast, direct support for FDI-led growth is relatively weak, which implies that trade openness has played a more significant role than FDI in influencing Thai economic growth. However, the results reveal a subtle role for technology transfer through the complementary effect of trade on FDI, and FDI on government expenditure, which henceforth influences human capital development with spillovers into domestic investment and growth. This leads us to argue that there is a potential role for FDI interacting with human capital in influencing the future development of the Thai economy, given its active policy of FDI promotion over the past decade.",

We develop a model which formalises a mechanism to allow for the influence of external debt in the transmission of FDI-generated externalities and conduct threshold regressions to test the existence of a debt contingency effect which limits the positive impact of inward FDI on growth. Using annual as well as five-year averaged data for 39 developing countries over the period 1984-2010, our findings support the hypothesis that FDI-induced growth is dependent on the external debt constraint. In particular, we show that beyond a certain threshold high indebtedness constrains economies from reaping growth benefits from FDI as they seek to reduce their debt levels. In this scenario, the evidence also shows that increasing financial development can mitigate the negative influence of high external debt on the FDI-growth nexus.",

The issues considered include foreign direct investment (FDI) policies, recent trends on growth, civil conflict, institutional development, financial sector development, external debt, and other macroeconomic factors. These are identified as pertinent areas where LDCs have faced major challenges in their endeavours to improve economic welfare since they are related to the absorptive capacities, which are important for accruing growth benefits from inward FDI in LDCs. It is anticipated that coverage of these issues will enlighten the issues that these countries face in order to attract and utilise inward FDI.

        "abstract": "Insights from behavioural economics suggest that individuals rely on different discount rates to assess the present values of gains and losses (the sign effect). They also suggest that individuals rely on different discount rates to assess investment in financial, environmental and health domains. A first objective is to further consider these valence versus domain effects.   The second, novel, objective is to question whether individuals are likely to employ a higher discount rate for the benefits of investment if they also derive intrinsic value from action. The analysis focuses on perceptions of intrinsic value derived from action to conserve the environment. Will intrinsic motivation increase the sign effect and the difference between the discount rate in different domains? In a questionnaire survey, we collected data from 450 undergraduate students. Participants made choices between hypothetical financial, environmental and health gains and losses that took effect either immediately, or with a delay of 10 years. Results suggest the presence of valence and domain effects and further suggests that intrinsic motivation over action is likely to increase present bias by increasing the sign effect. This dimension of time preference is likely to have an impact on differences between discount rates in different domains. ",

        "abstract": "The dissemination of robust asset price data can help improve market efficiency, resource allocation and investment analysis. Land prices influence housing affordability, food security and the carbon infrastructure. Yet price and return histories for farmland in England are fragmented. To provide perspective, a long farmland price series is needed to improve transparency and bring the asset class into line with commercial and residential real estate. After reviewing the historical backdrop and considering methodology, this research uses a chain-linking approach to construct a long-term farmland price series for England. It then adjusts the series for inflation to examine real land prices. The resulting two-century English farmland prices series contributes to farmland market analysis. Notwithstanding some concerns with long-run chain component heterogeneity, the combined series helps us to understand English average farmland price dynamics. As measured by the geometric mean, English land price real capital returns have been positive over more than two centuries. Farmland real price growth was 0.33 per cent annually from 1781 to 2013 and 0.71 per cent from 1801 to 2013. The series contributes to an understanding of land price dynamics.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficiency of peripheral European domestic banks and examines the effects of bank-risk determinants on their performance over 2007\u20132014. Data Envelopment Analysis is utilised on a Malmquist Productivity Index in order to calculate the bank efficiency scores. Next, a Double Bootstrapped Truncated Regression is applied to obtain bias-corrected scores and examine whether changes in the financial conditions affect differently banks\u2019 efficiency levels. The analysis accounts for the sovereign debt crisis period and for different levels of financial development in the countries under study. Such an application in the respective European banking setting is unique. The proposed method also copes with common misspecification problems observed in regression models based on efficiency scores. The results have important policy implications for the Euro area, as they indicate the existence of a periphery efficiency meta-frontier. Liquidity and credit risk are found to negatively affect banks productivity, whereas capital and profit risk have a positive impact on their performance. The crisis period is found to augment these effects, while bank-risk variables affect more banks' efficiency when lower levels of financial development are observed.",

        "abstract": "While considerable research has been conducted on consumer attitude towards foreign products, most of these studies focuses on the attitude of products from Western developed countries. Our study intends to investigate the effects of consumers\u2019 national identification and culture sensitivity on their perceived risk of buying products from Eastern developing countries. Especially, this study advances the literature by identifying the mediation effect of consumer ethnocentrism and the moderating effect of consumer value consciousness. Taking China and India as focal emerging economies, the consumer survey (n=308) in the UK produced the following results. First, UK consumers\u2019 national identification is positively related to their perceived risk of buying eastern products through consumer ethnocentrism, whilst their cultural sensitivity has a negative relationship. Second, the effect of consumer ethnocentrism on the perceived risk of buying eastern products is moderated by consumer value consciousness. Third, value consciousness also attenuates the indirect relationships between national identification / cultural sensitivity and perceived risk via consumer ethnocentrism.",

        "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 Shari\u2019ah is the foundation of Islamic banks. Although all the Islamic banks required complying with the Shari\u2019ah requirements fully, the level of compliance differs among the Islamic banks. At the same time, Islamic banks have been performing well, but all do not demonstrate similar financial performance. This paper aims to explore whether Shari\u2019ah compliance efficiency makes any difference in financial performance of Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited (IBBL).Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This study used IBBL as a case. For exploring the issue of study, this paper applied an e-mail interview approach and interviewed 24 interviewees including financial analysts, IBBL clients and executives of regulatory bodies, the IBBL and other Islamic- and interest-based traditional banks. Interview opinions are then analyzed and interpreted for a deeper understanding of the topic.Findings \u2013 The study observed that some other factors influence the financial performance of IBBL, but Shari\u2019ah compliance is the dominant instinct of acquiring the leading position. Superior Shari\u2019ah compliance creates internal strengths and external opportunities that facilitate IBBL in achieving higher financial performance. Most interviewees argued that Shari\u2019ah is the only disposition that makes IBBL unique. Moreover, the bank that considerably follows Shari\u2019ah gets better financial outcomes.Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study used a qualitative method using interview responses only for evaluating the relationship between Shari\u2019ah compliance and financial performance. Further study may be conducted based on a quantitative approach.Practical implications \u2013 This paper expects to uphold the significance of Shari\u2019ah in improving the financial performance of IBBL and simultaneously motivating the parties associated with the Islamic banks in enhancing the level of Shari\u2019ah compliance. Moreover, this study provides new insights into the importanceIslamic banks and their performance in relation to the choice of customers.Originality/value \u2013 This study explores the significance of Shari\u2019ah compliance in creating avenues for greater financial performance and develops a model showing the ways how Shari\u2019ah compliance leads Islamic banks to achieve higher financial positions.Keywords Bangladesh, Shari\u2019ah compliance, Financial performance, IBBL, Islamic bank",

It argues for the establishment of an international legal mechanism for securing the accountability of TNCs particularly in the context of developing countries with notoriously weak governance mechanisms to protect all relevant stakeholders. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach: The study adopts insights from the fields of management and international law to draw out synergies from particular understandings of corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and international human rights. The governance challenges in developing countries with regard to securing the accountability of TNCs is illustrated with the Nigerian experience of oil-industry legislation reform. \n\nFindings: The specific context of the experiences of developing countries in Africa on the operations of TNCs particularly commends the need and expedience to create an international legal regime for ensuring the accountability of TNCs. \n\nOriginality/value: Mainstream research in this area has focused mainly on self and voluntary models of regulation and accountability that have privileged the legal fiction of the corporate status of TNCs. This article departs from that model to argue for an enforceable model of TNC accountability based on an international mechanism.\n\n",

        "publication title": "Accounting for the Environment: Accountability in the Nigerian cement industry",
        "abstract": "The focus of this thesis is to study corporate environmental accounting in Nigeria, specifically analysing how corporate environmental issues (CEIs) are accounted for in the Nigerian cement industry. Environmental pollution arising from corporate operations has been a major concern among transnational organisations (e.g. World Bank, IMF), governments, policymakers and society. Over the past two or more decades, environmental issues have taken on a more significant role in business decisions, corporate planning and global politics (Boutros-Ghali, 1992; Gray et al., 2014). Environmental issues have certainly deserved attention from academia so that research could be undertaken to understand and address the problems (see Freeman, 1984; Strong, 1992; Callan and Thomas, 2000; Darabaris, 2008). There have been various pieces of research on corporate environmental accounting, however their focus has principally been on issues in developed countries (e.g. Buhr and Freedman, 1996; O\u2019Dwyer, 2005; Gray 2010). Developing and emerging economies are in fact creating significant amounts of environmental pollution on a daily basis due to their industrial development (UNEP, 2011; World Bank, 2014; WHO, 2014). Among others, Nigeria has been identified as one such country, with a high level of environmental pollution that contributes significantly to global environmental problems (Adeoti, 2001; UNEP, 2011; Yale, 2012). In the same vein, corporations in Nigeria have been found to be a key contributor for this problem. While corporations should be held accountable for their impacts on the environment, the political, economic and social context in Nigeria have all made corporate environmental accounting a challenge to be achieved. This highlights the need for more research in this area in order to enhance our knowledge on corporate environmental accounting issues in a developing country such as Nigeria, as well as potentially to initiate discussions on how to resolve corporate environmental problems. Most studies in Nigeria have looked at the impacts of environmental issues with no research focused on the management and reporting of environmental issues by corporations in the country and in particular, the cement industry (up to the time when this thesis was written). Therefore, this thesis examined how corporations in particular cement companies have been managing, accounting and reporting environmental issues generated by their operational activities in Nigeria. In order to achieve the purpose of the thesis, it has been necessary to adopt a subjectivity ontology and interpretive epistemology, which entails the use of qualitative perspectives. The study chose a case study approach (two companies were selected to be the case studies) and collected empirical data using a combination of semi-structured interviews, visual techniques and documentary analysis. Unlike most studies in Nigeria that have used the survey questionnaire approach (Owolabi, 2008; Ngwakwe, 2009; Oba et al., 2012; Hassan and Kouhy, 2013), this thesis will provide a more insightful qualitative view on corporate environmental accounting practices in Nigeria. The study also relied on convergent institutional and resource dependence theories as conceptualised by Oliver (1991) to provide a better understanding of CEIs management and reporting in the two chosen cases in particular and Nigeria as whole. The research found that the cement industry was a key environmental polluter in Nigeria, and that companies were under pressure from a number of agents to reduce environmental pollution. It further showed that environmental accountability practices in the Nigerian cement sector are largely influenced by the external institutional environment/factors, and that environmental accountability practices have become more a means of ensuring legitimacy with no significant impact on the wellbeing of citizens and the environment. It also demonstrated that the case studies adopted certain strategies in confronting the challenges from external institutions. Finally, the study contributes to the existing literature on social and environmental accounting research, especially from an emerging countries perspective. The findings from the research will also have theoretical and practical policy implications in Nigeria and the world at large.",

        "publication title": "Accounting Standards Complexity, Audit Fees and Financial Analyst Forecasts in Australia",
        "abstract": "While the beneficial effects of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on financial reporting quality, cost of capital, cross-country investment, corporate decision making and governance are well studied in the literature, there is relatively little research on the cost side of IFRS adoption and its impact on users. This thesis contributes by investigating the impact of IFRS complexity on two important groups of users of financial reports namely auditors and financial analysts. The hypotheses are built on the premise that principles-based standards are more complex than rules-based standards. This study examines the relationships between IFRS complexity, audit fees, and analyst forecast properties. IFRS is likely to require more of auditors in terms of professional expertise, time and effort, hence resulting in higher audit fees. Financial analysts may be similarly affected by the complexity of IFRS resulting in less accurate forecasts on key financial components. This thesis measures IFRS complexity based on individual IFRS standards specifically identified as having higher levels of complexity. Scores are then calculated to indicate the difference between these IFRS standards and their equivalent previous domestic accounting standards. The degree of complexity is also measured at aggregate level to indicate an overall complexity impact based on the combined score for all identified 'complex' IFRS standards. Findings indicate that aggregate IFRS complexity is positively and significantly associated with audit fees but that specific IFRS standards are identifiable as being paiticularly complex, hence explaining much of the positive relationship with audit fees. The results also reveal that the incremental effect of IFRS complexity on audit fees is more pronounced when finns are audited by city-level industly specialists as opposed to those audited by non\u00adindustly specialists. Furthermore, IFRS complexity is found to have a positive and significant association with analyst forecast properties (forecast errors, forecast dispersion, and forecast revision). Surprisingly some of the standards identified as being more complex for auditors (i.e., driving higher audit fees) do not appear similarly complex in relation to financial analyst forecast properties. Finally, this thesis investigates the moderating role of high quality audits (proxied by industry specialist auditors) on complexity and analyst forecast properties and finds that forecast errors decrease for firms which are exposed to higher levels of IFRS complexity if they are audited by city-level industry specialists. This study provides important insights for regulator regarding the complexity of specific IFRS standards. Findings may also be of benefit to countries which are in the process of adopting IFRS or planning to do so.",

        "abstract": "Higher education institutions can contribute into regional growth via the services of teaching they provide, the research activity they develop and the administration spillover effects on the local markets they operate. This paper attempts to quantify the impact of university expenditures on the regionally produced product (GDP). More specifically, we focus on the expenditure effects of the Hellenic Open University on the GDP of the 13 Greek regions. In our analysis we distinguish between direct and indirect effects by identifying as direct effects all initial expenditures incurred by the HOU while we identify and subsequently calculate as indirect effects the increases in local output caused by the interactions of different sectors of the regional economy. For the calculation of indirect effects we use the input\u2013output methodology. An input\u2013output system shows the intermediate transactions between sectors and the primary inputs, as well as, the final demand of each sector. This is a general equilibrium system that records all the inter-sector transactions presenting a complete picture of the economy under examination and being the appropriate system to be used for calculating the total effect of university expenditure on regional GDP. Our results suggest that the economic impact of HOU is (a) significant to the Greek peripheries and its size varies across regions; (b) indirect regional effects boost the direct regional effects by 60 % creating an overall size of the HOU expenses GDP multiplier by 1.6 on average. Moreover, our findings may have two straightforward policy implications that could be useful to those exercising policy making: first, the quantification of HOU economic impact on all Greek peripheries is not only useful for assessing the economic role of HOU at regional level but it could also been seen as a benchmark in assessing the impact of other similar regional educational activities. Secondly, the economic impact of HOU in each periphery can be a useful tool in assessing alternative non-educational, regional projects, aiming to fight the high unemployment arisen due to economic crisis that bedevils Greece and its peripheries in the last 5 years.",

Some proponents make cases for strong pegs and institutions as viable alternatives to currency unions. Using cluster analysis, disaggregating panels into sub-samples and distinguishing shocks from responses in the examination of business cycle synchronisation provide more subtle policy implications. We caution that for inquiries using the same theoretical underpinnings, variables and methods just by modifying the scope/context and periodicity may only contribute to increasing the number of conflicting findings.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how an increase in information-sharing bureaus affects financial access. We employed contemporary and non-contemporary interactive quantile regressions in 53 African countries for the period 2004-2011. Information-sharing bureaus are proxied with public credit registries and private credit offices. Financial development dynamics involving depth (at overall economic and financial system levels), efficiency (at banking and financial system levels), activity (from banking and financial system perspectives), and size are used. Two key findings are established. First, the effect of an increase in private credit bureaus is not clearly noticeable on financial access, probably because private credit agencies are still to be established in many countries. Second, an increase in public credit registries for the most part improves financial allocation efficiency and activity (or credit) between the 25th and 75th quartiles. As a main policy implication, countries in the top and bottom ends of the financial efficiency and activity distributions are unlikely to benefit from enhanced financial allocation efficiency as a result of an increase in public credit registries.Publisher Statement: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.",

After a review of extant literatures on existing DfD practices and tools, it became evident that none of the tools is BIM compliant and that BIM implementation has been ignored for end-of-life activities. To understand how BIM could be employed for DfD and to identify essential functionalities for a BIM-based deconstruction tool, Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with professionals who have utilised BIM on their projects. The interview transcripts of the FGIs were analysed using descriptive interpretive analysis to identify common themes based on the experiences of the participants. The themes highlight functionalities of BIM in driving effective DfD process, which include improved collaboration among stakeholders, visualisation of deconstruction process, identification of recoverable materials, deconstruction plan development, performance analysis and simulation of end-of-life alternatives, improved building lifecycle management, and interoperability with existing BIM software. The results provide the needed technological support for developing tools for BIM compliant DfD tools.\n\n",

We measure the intensity of economic ties with three variables: bilateral trade flows between the partner country and the US as well as FDI and aid flows from the US to the partner country. Our results suggest that both good trade relations prior to the conflict and the prospects of their further improvements increase the willingness of countries to join the coalition. In spite of the anecdotal evidence, we find no empirical evidence that the dependence on American FDI or aid affected countries decision on Iraq war participation.",

We show that innovations in optimism impact key macroeconomic variables in the same way that a contractionary monetary policy would. We find that increasing optimism shocks in MPC communication leads to rising inflation, falling output, declining stock market returns and a rise in the Pound value. We further find evidence that optimism shocks reduce credit availability, the money supply, retail sales as well as earnings. Finally, government bond yields also tend to rise in response to optimism shocks.",

        "abstract": "This paper uses panel cointegration with a corresponding vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate the changes in the value relevance of accounting information before and after the mandatory adoption of IFRS in Germany and the UK under three different valuation models. First, a basic Ohlson model where our results indicate that while the value relevance of the book values of equity has declined, it has been replaced by the increasing prominence of earnings in both Germany and the UK after the switch to the IFRS. Second, a modified model, which shows that the incremental value relevance of both earnings and book values are considerably higher in the long term for firms in the UK than in Germany. Third, a simultaneous addition of accounting and macroeconomic variables in an extended model, revealed a significant rise in the relative predictive power of the book value of equity in the UK compared with the more noticeable impact on the value relevance of earnings in Germany. Further, our results show a statistically significant negative coefficient on the lagged error correction term indicates that a long-run Granger-causal relationship exists between our accounting variables and share prices in the UK. Collectively, the explanatory power of our three equity valuation models is lower in Germany than in the UK, reflecting the former country\u2019s conservative financial reporting system. The usefulness of policy reforms for enhancing the complementarity of financial accounting information and economic data is highlighted in this study.\n\n",

It explores the nexus between primary food production, urban food and waste and outlined strategies to produce a more holistic food system. The chapter investigates the notion of 'urban consciousness' and its relationship with 'smart cities', and quality of life. It investigates issues around urban megaprojects in smart development. Some megaprojects radically transform but others backfire and waste resources or damage the environment. The indicative link between smart cities and university ranks, and extensive econometric evidence suggest that universities are central to smart cities. To manage development pressures and improve resource allocation, smart cities need reliable information systems.",

Rating disagreements have a significant connection with subsequent negative credit actions by each agency. However, links among Moody\u2019s/Fitch actions and their rating disagreements with other agencies have weakened in the post-regulation period. We also find that only S&P\u2019s negative credit signals affect the own-country stock market and spill over to other European markets, but this is concentrated in the pre-regulation period.

        "abstract": "Environmental issues such as pollution and the adverse consequences they are having in climate change have drawn a global attention. The extant literature shows that environmental problems and the scale of consequences vary across developing and developed countries (Yale, 2005). A major issue within emerging economies has been the controlling of emissions, the rise of which has become unprecedented as the economies of these countries continue to expand. Prior work in Nigeria has illustrated a high rate of environmental pollutions led to by the expansion of oil extraction and other industrial activities (Hassan and Kouhy, 2013).  In the last few years, the country has undertaken various initiatives, including the implementation of the Kyoto protocol, as part of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. The extant literature has covered the impacts of such initiatives in the oil and energy sector (Hassan and Kouhy, 2013). However, the environmental impacts of other industries and the ways these industries are discharging their accountability have remained under-researched. The study adds to the literature by investigating how the cement industry - the second largest contributor to the socio-economic growth and development of Nigeria, (Mojekwu, 2013) - has been discharging its corporate and environmental accountability. Drawing on institutional theory, the study unfolds the types of strategies that Nigerian cement companies have adopted to report their carbon emissions and discharge environmental accountability. ",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the behavior of crude oil prices, government bonds and stock market indices around outbreaks of severe international crises and wars. Using a constant-mean-return event study, we show that these events are associated with positive and significant abnormal returns on oil and bonds, which means that these two asset classes can potentially shelter shareholders from plummeting equity values during international crises. A formal safe haven analysis confirms this insight. Such price movements may reflect a reallocation of funds across asset classes in response to the events, as well as shifts in the demand for oil due to precautionary, speculative and military motives. We also calculate the weights for optimal portfolios, which could provide insurance against conflict risk.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Energy Economics.

The effective timing of policy actions is an open challenge issue to researchers and also a much needed rule of thumb to policy makers and private agents. This paper aims to (a) derive the influencing factors of a tourism demand function and (b) identify the time impact of these factors, thus, allowing the formulations of effective policy actions, by both, governmental tourism authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore. Our findings suggest that tourism government authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore should choose the timing of their actions depending upon the anticipated factor changes and their estimated impact. That is, if exchange rate variability is anticipated then policy actions should start at least twelve months prior to the start of the tourist period. If, a keen price competition is expected to prevail then the best timing of policy actions is nine months ahead the tourism period. If income improvements in origin countries could be expected, then a rather shorter timing action of six months would be available to tourism authorities and private agents in Singapore.",

We find that following the Brexit vote, volatility persistence increased significantly in the stock markets but decreased in the foreign exchange market. However we uncover similar patterns in the dynamics of volatility across both markets, with the post Brexit-vote news effect generally contributing less to volatility persistence. Our findings suggest that the increased post Brexit-vote volatility persistence is mainly driven by rising forecast variance from previous periods and that investors may have already priced in the news from the Brexit vote.

The empirical evidence is based on an updated sample of 53 African countries for the period 2005\u20132012.ResultsThe following findings are established. First, the impacts of aid dynamics with high degrees of substitution are positive. These include aid for: social infrastructure, economic infrastructure, the productive sector, and multisectors. Second, the effect of humanitarian assistance is consistently negative across specifications and models. Third, the effects of program assistance and action on debt are ambiguous because they become positive with the GMM technique.ConclusionsJustifications for these changes and clarifications with respect to existing literature are provided.

Interactive quantile regressions are used. Findings -   First, with the exception of unclear terrorism, bilateral aid can be used to mitigate the potentially negative effect of terrorism on fuel exports in bottom quintiles of the fuel export distribution. Second, multilateral aid can be used to reduce the negative effect of transnational terrorism on fuel exports exclusively in the highest (90th) quintile of fuel exports.  The corresponding modifying thresholds are within policy ranges disclosed in the summary statistics.  Practical implications- While the policy instrument of bilateral aid is most relevant in countries with below-median fuel exports, the policy instrument of multilateral aid is effective with respect to transnational terrorism in countries with the highest levels of fuel exports.Originality/value \u2013This study contributes to the literature on the role of external flows in reducing the negative externalities of terrorism on development outcomes.

Political, economic, social and general globalisation variables are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and Instrumental Quantile Regressions (IQR). While estimated coefficients are not significant in GMM results, for IQR, globalisation positively affects inclusive human development and the favourable effect is higher in countries with high initial levels of inclusive development. The main economic implication is that in the post-2015 development agenda, countries would benefit more from globalisation by increasing their levels of inclusive development.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of hedging and speculative pressures on the transition of the spot-futures relationship in metal and energy markets. We build a Markov regime switching (MRS) model where hedging and speculative pressures affect the transition probabilities between a stronger and weaker spot-futures relationship. It is found that hedging pressure increases the likelihood of transition, i.e. destabilises the existing spot-futures relationship, while speculative pressure reduces it, i.e. stabilises the relationship, in the copper, crude oil and natural gas markets, but this effect is relatively weak in the silver and heating oil markets. We also examine whether these findings generate practical benefits by testing the hedging effectiveness of the minimum variance hedge ratios (MVH) derived from the MRS models with hedging and speculative pressures. A relatively strong reduction of the portfolio variance, hedger's utility and value at risk (VaR) is observed in the energy markets.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in International Review of Financial Analysis.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a novel approach to dissect cycles in a form of a three-step algorithm. First, the Hodrick-Prescott de-trends the selected variables. Second, volatility (measured by the variance) screens periods of atypical fluctuations in the series. Finally, the series is regressed against its past values to assess the level of persistence. The sequential steps screen the length of the cycles in UK commercial property market to facilitate interpretation. Findings: The estimates suggest that UK commercial property market follows an eight-year cycle. Combined modelling results indicate that the current market trend is likely to change over the coming year. The modelling suggests increasing probability of a market correction in late 2016/early 2017. Practical implications: This updated appreciation of the UK commercial property cycle duration allows for better market timing and investment decision making.",

Intraday herding is significant in the Euronext as a group and presents us with size, industry and country effects.

Intraday herding is found to be significant before, during and after the 2007-09 financial crisis period, with its presence appearing the least strong during the crisis.

Building on research done previously and data from an original survey, the paper carries out a principal descriptive analysis (PDA) to construct the main dimensions on which financial consumer agents diverge. Five key components emerged from the PDA that is interpreted with the help of a survey covering different types of consumers. Furthermore, it explores the perceived association of Islamic financial values with ethical norms in the West. The findings help us understand how IF has been conceptualised by consumers in non-Muslim majority markets. The five components identified shed light on the constructs that have informed the growth of IF as an ethical option in international non-Muslim majority markets. This advocates the view that IF should be characterised by multidimensional drivers in the global financial market, rather than a single component of religious values.  ",

        "abstract": "This article complements existing literature on the aid-institutions nexus by focusing on political rights, aid volatilities, and the post-Berlin Wall period. Our findings show that, while foreign aid does not have a significant effect on political rights, foreign aid volatilities do mitigate democracy in recipient countries. Such volatilities could be used by populist parties to promote a neocolonial agenda, instill nationalistic sentiments, and consolidate their grip on power. This is especially true when donors are asking for standards that the majority of the population in control does not want and political leaders are unwilling to implement them. Our empirical evidence is based on 53 African countries for the period from 1996 to 2010. As a main policy implication, creating uncertainties in foreign aid for political rights enhancement in African countries may achieve the opposite results. We also discuss other implications, including the need for an \u201cAfter-Washington\u201d Consensus.",

Statistical analysis revealed that, on average, the students were significantly more accurate at self-evaluating the quality of their work in the second year than they had been in the first year. However there was considerable variation in this improvement. Those students who demonstrated the greatest improvement were firstly those who were awarded higher marks by the tutor for their second year essay and secondly, those who had been the least accurate at judging the quality of their first year essay. Other student characteristics such as different measures of student ability and gender had no significant impact on the changes in accuracy.

        "publication title": "Managing Conflict of Interests in Professional Accounting Firms",
        "abstract": "This study views conflict of interests in professional accounting firms through the lens of behavioural risk management. The research problem driving this study is the accounting professionals\u2019 deviant decision-making behaviour due to conflict of interests. Extant literature suggests that the prevalence of said problem is attributable to the ineffective management of conflicting interests \u2013 the existing procedures do not account, sufficiently, for the accounting professionals\u2019 independence in fact. This research builds, primarily, on the work of Moore, Tanlu and Bazerman (2010) and Guiral, Rodgers, Ruiz and Gonzalo (2010). Although they attempted to address the professionals\u2019 independence in fact by examining the psychological and cognitive impacts of conflict of interests, there still is a lack of understanding about the interaction of conflict of interests with decision-making. Consequently, there have been repeated calls for more research to understand how conflict of interests operates at the level of an individual accounting professional. Accordingly, this study is aimed at examining the process through which conflict of interests affects accounting professionals\u2019 decision-making behaviour. To achieve this aim, a cognitive approach has been developed through integration of social cognitive theory and throughput model of decision-making. This research adopts a quantitative approach to investigation and the data have been collected by conducting a quasi-experiment with 105 professionals from the Big Four accounting firms in the UK. Likert-type items/scales are used to record data as the professionals\u2019 self-reports on their perceptions and behaviour. Partial Least Squares-Path Analysis has been implemented for data analysis and hypotheses testing. Following the post-positivists stance, the concern is \u2018failure to reject\u2019 a hypothesis rather than \u2018proving\u2019 it. The empirical results provide that the professionals\u2019 positive outcome expectancy of compliant decision-making (POE), perceived difficulty in making compliant decisions (PD) and ethical judgements (EJ) play mediating role in the relationship between conflict of interests (CoI) and the likelihood of deviant decision-making behaviour (DD). The low POE, high PD and less EJ are evidenced to be the situational cognitive predictors and the high propensity to morally disengage (PMD) the dispositional cognitive predictor of DD. Decision-making behaviour is evidenced to be prone to bias due to the significant role of POE and PD in the decision-making process. These results suggest that the process through which CoI affects accounting professionals\u2019 decision-making behaviour is governed through the agency of their POE, PD and EJ. During this process, CoI plays biasing role and due to which the deviations from compliant behaviour might occur even undesirably. Therefore, DD is high in case of the professionals who perceive the negative outcomes of compliant decision-making to outweigh its positive outcomes, perceive high difficulty in making the given compliant decision, form a judgement that deviant decision choice is the most ethical and have high propensity of considering unethical behaviour as acceptable. Thus, in the events of conflict of interests, the likelihood of deviant behaviour can be reduced through encouraging amongst professionals the high POE, low PD, high EJ and low PMD. This study holds significance since it provides the much-needed empirical evidence for the role of accounting professionals\u2019 cognitive processes in the relationship between conflict of interests and their decision-making behaviour. The cognitive approach adopted in this study provides a novel perspective for investigating the decision-making process. Moreover, the robust experiment employed for data collection adds to the extant research that lacks in experimental scenarios for addressing conflict of interests. Since all the insights revealed by this study\u2019s results are relevant to the professionals\u2019 state of mind, these insights can be combined to strengthen their independence in fact \u2013 to this end, I have proposed a behavioural framework to complement the accounting firms\u2019 current efforts for managing conflict of interests. On a practical level, the professional accounting firms, the accounting professionals, the regulators and the other relevant professions can use this study\u2019s findings and the new knowledge for making better decisions and to improve their policies.",

Notwithstanding controversy, macroeconomic turbulence, policy flux, project complexity and practical difficulties vary in diverse architectural, urban design, institutional and geographic settings.

Smart urban development involves multidisciplinary collaboration and widespread consultation. Big data and high-tech decision-support systems (DSS) can be part of the solution but not without administrative competency, civic professionalism and policy learning. Strategic plans should balance logistic infrastructure imperatives with ecological and local considerations. Institutionally, traditional planning confronts alternate policy foci. For Healy 'Clashes between conceptual frameworks and legitimising rationales are commonplace'. The rapidly evolving global economy accentuates stakeholder tensions. Urban regeneration quality is multifaceted but considerations include architecture and design merit, density and housing affordability, public realm enhancement, connective infrastructure. Smart development is adaptable and evolves in response to multiple pressures. It operates in a networked, collaborative system of vertical, horizontal and bottom-up local institutions.",

        "abstract": "The role of real estate in our cities is crucial to building sustainable and resilient urban futures. Smart Urban Regeneration brings together institutional, planning and real estate insights into an innovative regeneration framework for academics, students and property professionals. Starting by identifying key urban issues within the historical urban and planning backdrop, the book goes on to explore future visions, the role of institutions and key mechanisms for smart urban regeneration. Throughout the book, international case studies and discussion questions help to draw out global implications for urban stakeholders. Real estate professionals face a real challenge to build visionary developments which resonate locally yet mitigate climate change and curb sprawl, and foster biodiversity. By avoiding the dangers of speculative excess on one side and complacency on the other, Smart Urban Regeneration shows how transformation aspirations can be achieved sustainably. Academics, students and professionals who are involved in real estate, urban planning, property investment, community development and sustainability will find this book an essential guide to smart urban regeneration investment.",

We find that less liquid stocks are associated with higher probability of bankruptcy, although there is substantial heterogeneity across industries regarding the predictive power of the liquidity measure on the likelihood of bankruptcy.

        "abstract": "Mobile payment services are experiencing the fastest growth compared to other paymentmethods, mainly due to the ever-increasing popularity of smartphones in recent years. Even though the technology has been available for more than a decade, mobile payment has been adopted into widespread usage only in some countries, including Japan, South Korea, Kenya and the Philippines. Nonetheless, other parts of the world appear to be catching up fast and it is important for both public and private sectors to understand the determinants of mobile payment adoption. This study investigates the drivers of mobile payment adoption in the past decade through comparative studies of both developed and developing countries. Conceptual frameworks, including the network effects and broadband ecosystem, are also applied to support the analysis offered in this paper. Moreover, this study explores the similarities and differences between the above mentioned countries and why they have been more successful in adopting the mobile payment technology compared to other states, such as the US and European countries.The key finding is that a successful and widespread adoption of mobile payment requiresstrongly growing demand and ready availability of infrastructure and technology on the supply side. The rapidly growing popularity of smartphones fueled the demand side by making the new payment technology reachable by large groups of consumers. Nevertheless, the use of mobile payment could not be significantly increased without an introduction of killer applications in each country or region. This is where the regulators in both financial and telecommunication sectors play a crucial role. A good combination of regulation and/or policy on the supply and demand sides is a way forward. ",

        "abstract": "Housing costs form a substantial share of aggregate demand in the UK. This study examines the distribution of total expenditure-to-income by homeownership status at the end of the recent recession in 2010. Multivariate quantile regressions uncover four important points. First, owner-occupiers in England have considerably higher mean spending ratios than their peers in other parts of the UK; an indication of their wealthier status. Second, the average spending ratio for residential-occupiers in all UK regions, with the exception of Northern Ireland, is significantly higher than the mean ratio for tenants in both private and public properties. In this last region, the spending rate for private tenants is more prominent. Third, the disparity in the expenditure ratio between owner-occupiers and tenants is significantly more pronounced in England. Fourth, renters in public housing in Scotland and Wales have much higher spending ratios than their counterparts in private properties, reflecting a greater overall social security provided by the devolved government there. Policy implications allied with heterogeneity in the consumption effect of housing wealth across the different homeownership cohorts is discussed.Publisher Statement: The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-016-1409-z  ",

We employ a new data-set that disaggregates FDI inflows to primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. Second, we control for a richer set of economic and institutional variables that could determine FDI inflows including population, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the degree of trade openness, exchange rate variability, inflation, the governance structure of the host country using International Country Risk Guide data and its regime type using the POLITY autocracy\u2013democracy data. We also address the reverse causality between FDI and conflict and the potential endogeneity of explanatory variables by employing dynamic system generalised method of moments (GMM) techniques in estimation. Our results indicate that primary sector FDI flows to developing countries are not significantly affected by civil war, whereas secondary and tertiary sectors FDI are more sensitive to such outbreak, potentially leading to reversals of existing FDI. Among institutional variables, government stability and control of corruption are more significant compared to regime type, law and order, and bureaucratic quality. ",

Four terrorism indicators are used namely: domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are also employed namely: political governance (consisting of political stability and voice and accountability), economic governance (encompassing government effectiveness and regulation quality); institutional governance (entailing corruption-control and the rule of law) and general governance. The governance indicators are bundled by means of principal component analysis. The empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. Three key findings are established. First, all selected terrorism dynamics negatively affect political governance and its constituents. Second, evidence of a negative relationship is sparingly apparent in economic governance and its components.  Third, no proof was confirmed in relation to the impact of terrorism and institutional governance with its elements. Fourth, compared with domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism more negatively and significantly affects political, economic and general governances.  Policy implications are discussed. ",

        "abstract": "This paper analyses the performance consequences of board structure changes in Ghana for the study period 2000 to 2009. In 2003, the Ghanaian listed firms adopted the Ghanaian Corporate Governance Code on comply or explain basis but no study to date has analysed the pre-2003 and post-2003 board structure changes impact on firm performance in the Ghanaian environment. We predict that board structure changes prompted by the introduction of the Ghanaian Code in 2003 should lead to better firm performance. Using a panel regression model, our results show that duality decreases firm performance pre-2003, but those firms that separate the two posts in line with the recommendations of the Ghanaian Code did not perform better than those that combined the two post-2003. While we find no relationship between board committees and firm performance pre-2003, the relationship switched to positive and statistically significant post-2003. The most consistent result we find concerns board size. However, the non-executive director representation on the board appears to have no impact on firm performance. These results show that not all board structure recommendations introduced by the Ghanaian Code are effective in achieving superior performance in Ghana.Publisher Statement: This paper is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International License (CC BY-NC 4.0) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)",

By implementing the ARDL technique, this study intends to estimate the impact of money demand determinants in Italy over a long period (1861\u20132011) and to investigate the stability of the estimated relations. We show that instability cannot be excluded when a standard money demand function is estimated, irrespectively of the use of M1 or M2. Then, we argue that the reason for possible instability resides in the omission of relevant variables, as we show that a fully stable demand for narrow money (M1) can be obtained from an augmented money demand function involving real exchange rate and its volatility as additional explanatory variables. These results also allow us to argue that narrower monetary aggregates should be employed in order to obtain a stable estimated relation.",

The empirical decomposition is based on a sample of 1,530 banks operating in 88 countries over the period 1999-2011. We find that the net effect of financial liberalization on bank TFP growth is positive: the direct positive effect outweighs the negative one. An important policy implication flows from these findings.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides global empirical evidence on cross-country differences in scientific and technical publications. Its purpose is to model the future of scientific knowledge monopoly in order to understand whether the impressive growth experienced by latecomers in the industry has been accompanied by a similar catch-up in scientific capabilities and knowledge contribution. The empirical evidence for the period 1994\u20132010 is based on 41 panels which together consist of 99 countries. The large dataset allows us to disaggregate countries into fundamental characteristics based on income levels (high-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income and low-income), legal origins (English common-law, French civil-law, German civil-law and Scandinavian civil-law) and regional proximity (South Asia, Europe and Central Asia; East Asia and the Pacific; Middle East and North Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa). Three main issues are investigated: the presence or not of catch-up processes, the speed of the catch-up processes and the time needed for a complete elimination of country differences in scientific and technical publications. The findings based on absolute and conditional catch-up patterns broadly show that advanced countries will continue to dominate in scientific knowledge contribution. Policy implications are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This study explores external auditors\u2019 views on the importance of fraud factors in the assessment of financial reporting fraud risk. The study also sheds light on the root causes for auditors\u2019 bias in fraud risk assessment and proposes an alternative fraud triangle model that could be more suitable for audit professionals in the assessment of financial reporting fraud risk. The proposed auditors\u2019 fraud triangle model was designed after careful consideration of external auditors\u2019 views on what matters in the assessment of financial reporting fraud risk. While the traditional fraud triangle model assumes that all fraud factors have the same importance, the auditors in this study perceived management motivations as the most important fraud factor because management motivations are key antecedents to fraud. They also believe that management integrity comes second in terms of importance and that rationalisation of fraud should be viewed as a red flag for low management integrity rather than a separate fraud factor. The traditional fraud triangle did not include fraud perpetrators\u2019 capabilities while the auditors in this study believe that not every person is capable of exploiting existing opportunities for fraud and therefore auditors need to consider fraud perpetrators\u2019 capabilities in the assessment of fraud risk. From the auditors\u2019 perspective, power in the organisation, knowledge of the accounting system, and good understanding of internal control weaknesses are the main traits that enhance perpetrators\u2019 capabilities to commit financial reporting fraud. This study has implications for auditors and audit regulators, and suggest new directions for future research. ",

Drawing mainly on stakeholder theory, combined with legitimacy theory, this article addresses how host communities in Africa combat the challenge of environmental irresponsibility of TNCs. To illustrate the dimensions and dynamics of the challenge, this paper examines the experience of despoliation of Ogoniland by the oil giant, Shell, in Nigeria. The analysis draws attention to the significance of the role of individuals and civil society groups in securing accountability of one of the most formidable fronts of economic globalisation. The analysis is particularly relevant to the experience of environmental irresponsibility in the context of weak governance structures.",

The following main findings are established. First, it is primarily in the countries with the highest level of iron ore exports that terrorism affects exports. Second, bilateral aid has an impact on iron ore exports, while the evidence for such a relationship between multilateral aid and iron ore exports is limited. Third, there is limited support for the main hypothesis motivating this line of inquiry, notably that foreign aid can be used to mitigate a potentially negative effect of terrorism on resource exports. The results suggest that bilateral aid is more relevant at mitigating the negative effects of domestic and total terrorism on iron ore exports.",

External auditors are required by audit standards to assess and respond to the risk of illegal acts, yet neither the audit standards nor do prior studies providea guide for external auditors to audit bribery risks. Hence, the aim of the current study is to help external auditors assess and respond to bribery risks. To achieve this, the current study proposes a guide that might help external auditors assess and respond to bribery risks. The proposed guide is based on evidence from prior literature and the insights from the audit profession in Egypt. Data was collected by the means of mixed methods, mainly an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Our results supports the current body of knowledge that argued for the effectiveness of red flags in fraud risk assessments, however our study was the first to explore the effectiveness of red flags for bribery. Our findings also revealed that although red flags for bribery were perceived as effective in assessing bribery risks, not all of them have the same significance. Our study was the first to suggest how external auditors might respond to the heightened red flags for bribery. The current study also provides recommendations to audit regulators, audit firms, policy makers, and researchers on how to combat corruption and bribery.",

To establish whether the impact of financial openness on both bank risk and profit efficiency occurs directly or through each one of the two bank characteristics (efficiency and risk, respectively), we begin our analysis by investigating the potential reverse Granger causality between profit efficiency and risk using a dynamic simultaneous model via system GMM estimation. We then account explicitly for the role of bank risk in the estimation of bank profit efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis, allowing for the influence of different measures of financial openness and risk alongside other control variables. Our results indicate that financial openness reduces bank profit efficiency directly, not through changes in bank risk. We also find that financial openness increases bank risk indirectly, through the decreased bank profit efficiency channel.NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Journal of Financial Stability.

This paper investigates and reveals the multi-facets of ICT productivity and the mechanism through which ICT affects productivity by bringing all the distinct streams of existing findings together. In particular, we develop a two-level frontier-efficiency model to examine how ICT's direct and indirect impact on different components of productivity is related to the economic growth in the US. Our empirical analysis has confirmed that ICT investment does contribute to productivity but not in the usual manner \u2013 we find a positive (but lagged) ICT effect on technological progress. We argue that for a positive ICT role on growth to actually take place, a period of negative relationship between productivity and ICT investment together with ICT-using sectors\u2019 capacity to learn from the embodied new technology was crucial. In addition, it took a learning period with appropriate complementary co-inventions for the new ICT-capital to become effective and its gains to be realized.

This study examines the consolidated financial statements of the top 170 listed companies in three major EU stock exchanges (UK, France and Germany) and uncovered a disparity in the use of common nomenclatures. The findings reveal that the inconsistencies in the application of terminologies such as statement of financial position instead of balance sheet and sequence of arrangement of assets in order of liquidity constitute the main differences for entities operating in the three countries.

The empirical evidence is based on interactive generalised methods of moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The following findings are established. First, PCRs and PCBs have negative effects on financial depth, with the magnitude of the former higher. Second, contrary to PCRs which have insignificant effects, PCBs have a negative impact on banking system efficiency. Third, PCRs and PCBs have negative impacts on financial activity, with the magnitude of the latter higher. Moreover, both of their marginal effects are negative. Fourth, PCRs and PCBs have positive effects on financial size, with the effect of the former higher. While marginal effects are positive, corresponding thresholds are not within range.

The adoption status is then regressed on a number of variables of interest. To establish that our results are robust, we used a combination of different regression techniques comprising OLS, multinomial and logistic regressions.\nFindings- In addition to GDP growth and education level, this paper adds new evidence to the literature by reporting the positive association between the level of democracy and the enforcement of securities\u2019 regulation on ISA adoption. It argues that political, economic, social and legal factors impact on ISA adoption in the IFSCs.\nResearch limitations/implications- The sample size is limited to 50 from a population of 99 IFSCs because of lack of data. Some of the independent variables are basically archival data. Reliance is placed on WEF with regard to the measurement of protection of minority interest, securities and exchange regulations, and on Economic Intelligence Unit for democracy index.\nPractical implications- This paper stresses the importance of ISAs in IFSCs and the role of political power and the enforcement of securities laws on the adoption of ISA.\nOriginality/value-This study fills the research gap relating to the absence of empirical studies on ISA adoption and its drivers in IFSCs.\n\n",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the possibility of mission drift in microfinance; a situation where Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) move away from targeting the poor and towards better-off clients. Using two different measures of poverty, the paper examines whether microfinance institutions in Uganda follow a developmental objective by expanding their access to poorer districts; and if the pattern observed varies across different types of MFIs. The analysis is conducted on 118 MFIs over the period 2009 \u2013 2013; adopting a static count data model and dynamic regression approach. We find that MFIs in Uganda are more likely to target richer districts during earlier years; however, poorer districts tend to catch up over time. This finding suggests that MFIs may wish to signal an improved financial performance by first establishing branches in better-off districts and then only later reaching out to poorer districts, employing cross-subsidisation. We also show that Commercial Bank MFIs are more likely to increase their presence in poorer districts than other types of MFIs, suggesting that protection against regulation and greater access to capital markets may make commercial MFIs the most qualified institutions to expand outreach to the unbanked segment of the world\u2019s poorer population.",

We investigate whether African democracies enjoy relatively better government quality (GQ) compared to their counterparts with more autocratic inclinations. The empirical evidence is based on instrumental variable two-stage least squares and fixed effects with data from 38 African countries for the period 1994-2010. Political regimes of democracy, polity, and autocracy are instrumented with income levels, legal origins, religious dominations, and press freedom to account for the GQ dynamics of corruption control, government effectiveness, voice and accountability, political stability, regulation quality, and the rule of law. Findings show that democracy has an edge over autocracy while the latter and polity overlap. As a policy implication, democracy once initiated should be accelerated to edge the appeals of authoritarian regimes.",

Regulatory changes on the horizon brought about by Basel Accord II will soon make it incumbent on Islamic banks and their competing conventional counterparts to have developed suitable risk management capabilities. There are two crucial steps that must precede the development of a robust risk management capability: 1] proper identification of risks and 2] accurate measurement of risks. However, the view that Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) are in some way insulated from certain types or risk, namely financial return risk, which is similar to interest rate risk for conventional banks, has prevented even the first step from being successfully taken by many Islamic banks. The main objective of this chapter is to explain why Islamic banks are exposed to a risk similar to interest rate risk, even if they do not directly pay or receive interest. A second objective is to discuss ways in which risk can be mitigated in IFIs.",

Few existing studies have analyzed the dividend lifecycle and signaling hypotheses related to these economies, and the current paper thus contributes to the empirical literature from this perspective. Using event study and regression analysis, the results confirm that dividends tend to support the lifecycle hypothesis rather than signaling theory in the frontier markets of GCC.

Consistent with this prediction, we present evidence that there are costs to having a second (and third) largest shareholder, especially when the largest shareholdings are similar in size.

        "abstract": "Terminal scale has been the subject of discrete episodes of hotly contested policy debates. From the perspective of port authorities or governments, knowing the Minimum Efficient Scale (MES) is salient, because they sometimes determine the port development or expansion based on the port capacity or the existing size of the terminal. Notwithstanding the importance of knowing the exact MES, extant literature has not managed to estimate MES in the port industry. This study aims to estimate the MES in the port industry in South Korea in order to identify whether Container Terminal Operators (CTOs) are under economies of scale, constant economies of scale or diseconomies of scale; we explore a bottom point of the average cost curve in order to suggest an adequate scale for the port industry in Korea. The finding demonstrates that undercapacity may be a strong issue in Korean container ports. However, CTOs in Busan port are in an overcapacity area given the market demand of container throughput in 2013, which is approximately 25 times larger than the estimated MES; in fact, all CTOs in Busan port operate at more than 20% of MES. This study then can provide port policy makers with a helpful tool to derive ex-ante MES level at the terminal designing stage and to adjust ex-post port investment decisions at the additional port capacity designing stage, which may contribute to avoiding overcapacity.NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Transport Policy.

        "abstract": "Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact corporate governance, measured by a governance index, on the performance of listed firms in a developing economy, Ghana. It also evaluates the effect of the introduction of a code of corporate governance on compliance rates across Ghanaian firms as well as assessing the impact of the code\u2019s introduction on firm performance for the study period 2000-2009.\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThe paper develops a Ghanaian corporate governance index (GCGI) containing 33 provisions to measure corporate governance quality during the pre-code and the post-code sub-periods. The authors use a panel data analytical framework and fixed effects regressions to analyse the governance-performance relationships.\nFindings\n\nAfter controlling for endogeneity, the authors find a statistically significant and positive relationship between the GCGI and firm performance. The analysis shows evidence of a statistically significant increase in the degree of compliance with the Ghanaian Code from the pre-2003 sub-period to the post-2003 sub-period. The authors also find that the introduction of the code has led to improved firm performance. However, not all elements of corporate governance appear to have a significant effect on firm performance.\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nOne limitation of this study is the development of a corporate governance index. The binary coding used to construct the GCGI may not reflect the relative importance of the different corporate governance provisions. This means that all elements included in the index are given equal weighting. Future research may assign weights to each of the corporate governance provisions but this may have the disadvantage of making subjective judgements relative to the importance of each corporate governance provision recommended by the Ghanaian Code.\nPractical implications\n\nThese results have important implications for both policy makers and companies. For policy makers, it is encouraging for the development of a code of corporate governance to regulate firms rather than enforcing rigid laws that may not be value relevant. For companies, the improvement in compliance with a code of corporate governance can provide a means of achieving improved performance.\nOriginality/value\n\nThis paper adds to the limited evidence on the governance-performance relationship in developing economies and in particular it analyses the role of a governance index. It is also the first paper to compare the pre- and the post-code governance index-performance relationship in an African or developing country.",

Econometrics analysis employing an augmented Solow model is conducted based on the panel data covering all the regions of Korea over the period 2000\u20132013.

        "abstract": "This study assesses the mobile phone in the diffusion of knowledge for better governance in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2012. For this purpose we employ Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The empirical evidence is based on three complementary knowledge diffusion variables (innovation, internet penetration and educational quality) and 10 governance indicators that are bundled and unbundled. The following are the main findings. First, there is an unconditional positive effect of mobile phone penetration on good governance. Second, the net effects on political, economic, and institutional governances that are associated with the interaction of the mobile phone with knowledge diffusion variables are positive for the most part. Third, countries with low levels of governance are catching-up their counterparts with higher levels of governance. The above findings are broadly consistent with theoretical underpinnings on the relevance of mobile phones in mitigating bad governance in Africa. The evidence of some insignificant net effects and decreasing marginal impacts may be an indication that the mobile phone could also be employed to decrease government quality. Overall, this study has established net positive effects for the most part. Five rationales could elicit the positive net effects on good governance from the interaction between mobile phones and knowledge diffusion, among others, the knowledge variables enhance: reach, access, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and interaction. In a nut shell, the positive net effects are apparent because the knowledge diffusion variables complement mobile phones in reducing information asymmetry and monopoly that create conducive conditions for bad governance. The contribution of the findings to existing theories and justifications of the underlying positive net effects are discussed.",

We identify frontier Africa as producing the greatest diversification benefits to an international investor and frontier Europe as providing the least. We also find evidence to suggest that low correlation considered in isolation is not necessarily a good proxy variable for identifying optimal diversification benefits.",

        "abstract": "This study assesses the synergy effects of governance in mobile phone penetration for inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000\u20132012. It employs a battery of interactive estimation techniques, namely: Fixed effects, Generalised Method of Moments and Tobit regressions. Concepts of political (voice and accountability and political stability/no violence), economic (government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional (corruption-control and rule of law) governance are employed. The following findings are established. The previously apparent positive correlation between mobile phones and inclusive development can be extended to a positive effect. Although political governance is overwhelmingly not significant across estimated models, the average effects from economic governance are higher relative to institutional governance. On the interactions between mobile phones and governance variables, while none are apparent in Fixed effects regressions, there are significant synergy effects in Generalised Method of Moments and Tobit estimations, notably, from: regulation quality in the former and political stability, voice and accountability and rule of law in the latter. There is consistent evidence of convergence in inclusive human development. Policy implications are discussed.NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Technovation.

        "abstract": "Diversification is an important strategic decision and a rare event. By definition, when undertaking a new diversification, a firm will not have direct internal experience of the venture. In this regard, external experience of similar diversifications provides a valuable lesson pool for the focal manager. While there are many studies of internal learning in organizational learning literature, research on external learning is still scarce. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for external experiential learning and applies it to study the effect of industry experience on diversification value. We report the novel finding of a cubic relationship between external learning from industry experience and diversification value. This indicates that industry experience matters to the outcomes of strategic decisions, but that the effect of this external experience on learning is conditional upon certain characteristics of the experience: namely specificity and heterogeneity.",

        "abstract": "The transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has shifted the policy debate from growth to \u2018quality of growth\u2019 (QG). We explore a new dataset on QG by the IMF and classify 93 developing countries for the period 1990\u20132011 in terms of Hopefuls, Contenders and Best Performers. The aims are as follows: (i) to depict the contradiction between high-growth and poor social welfare and (ii) to assess the influence of education and health spending on the QG. We use quantile regressions to articulate least and best QG performers. Two key findings emerge. First, 31 of the 33 countries in the Hopefuls category are in SSA. Second, the effect of health is decreasingly positive from Hopefuls to Best Performers, while the impact of education is increasingly positive. As a main policy implication, it would benefit countries in SSA to invest more in health relative to education now, but decrease such health expenditure and increase education spending as the economies in the sub-region make the transition from Hopeful to Contenders and finally to Best Performers in terms of \u2018quality of growth\u2019.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the determinants of good corporate governance across Ghanaian listed firms for the study period 2000 to 2009. The Ghanaian Code of corporate governance introduced in 2003 was the first attempt to make official corporate governance guidelines on best practices not backed by the force of law of which the Ghanaian firms were encouraged to comply with its provisions. As such, firms listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange are expected to comply with the recommended governance provisions in order to promote good corporate governance. Some of the key provisions in the code are separating the posts of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the board of directors, limiting the board size to between eight and sixteen directors, having at least one-third of the total membership of the board to be independent directors, and the establishment of separate board committees to be responsible for audit and executive remuneration. Other provisions call for improvement of the relationship between shareholders and managers, and provisions on financial affairs, auditing and disclosure practices. We develop a corporate governance index and its six subindices to measure firm-level governance quality. Annual reports of the Ghanaian listed firms are scored according to their governance disclosure during the whole period, 2000\u20132009 and pre 2003 and post 2003 introduction of the Ghanaian Code. A panel data analytical framework was used to find the determinants of strong corporate governance in Ghanaian listed firms. The empirical results over the whole period, 2000\u20132009 show statistically significant and positive relationship between external financing needs, firm size, institutional shareholdings and governance quality measured by the Ghanaian corporate governance index. While we find no relationship between external financing needs, director shareholding and governance quality pre 2003, the result is positive and statistically significant for post 2003. The most consistent relationship we find concerns firm size and institutional shareholdings. However, growth opportunities and firm performance measures appear to have no association with strong governance in Ghanaian firms. The results have important implications for the Ghanaian firms and regulators. In particular, the Ghanaian firms with high external financing needs would have to improve their governance structures in order to attract such facility. For regulators, it is important to have clear code of corporate governance guidelines in place where firms\u2019 governance practices can be benchmarked. In addition, the study contributes to our understanding of the firm attributes affecting strong corporate governance in emerging African economies.",

Its twin motivations are the importance of information on future house price movements to sector stakeholders and the limited number of related Lithuanian property market studies.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs ARIMA modelling approach. It assesses whether past is agood predictor of the future. It then examines issues relating to an application of this univariate time-series modelling technique in a forecasting context.FindingsAs the results of the study suggest, ARIMA is a useful technique to assess broad market price changes. Government and central bank can use ARIMA modelling approach to forecast national house price inflation. Developers can employ this methodology to drive successful house-building programme. Investor can incorporate forecasts from ARIMA models into investment strategy for timing purposes.Research limitations/implicationsCertainly, there are number of limitations attached to this particular modelling approach. Firm predictions about house price movements are also a challenge, as well as more research needs to be done in establishing a dynamic interrelationship between macro variables and the Lithuanian housing market.Originality/valueAlthough the research focused on Lithuania, the findings extend to global housing market. ARIMA house price modelling provides insights for a spectrum of stakeholders. The use of this modelling approach can be employed to improve monetary policy oversight, facilitate planning for infrastructure or social housing as a countercyclical policy and mitigate risk for investors. What is more, a greater appreciation of Lithuania housing market can act as a bellwether for real estate markets in other trade-exposed small country economies.",

Despite this consensus, empirical evidence presents major uncertainties as to the direction and degree of this influence. This study contributes to this debate by examining the relationship between board leadership structure and firm performance and the expense ratio, using propensity-score matching methods for Chinese PLCs from 2003\u20132010. It is reported that whilst CEO duality is not related to companies' profitability ratios, it is linked to a higher expense ratio compared to matched companies with a separate board leadership structure. This indicates that a separate board leadership structure is an effective corporate governance arrangement to reduce agency costs for Chinese PLCs.\n\n",

As a first step toward later modeling and application, we present a thoroughgoing literature review, a short commentary on bohemian phenomena, and suggested readings.

After discarding innumerable irrelevant and incidental papers, three strands remained for subsequent analysis: \u201cbohemian,\u201d \u201cbohemian + creative-city,\u201d and \u201csmart regeneration.\u201d The first is static or historically contextualized, situated best in the humanities.

The findings indicate that on average banks have a 40% return on equity. The fixed effects indicate that both internal and external factors are influential in determining the profitability of the banks. Specifically, the cost\u2013income ratio and capital ratio negatively and significantly influence profitability. Measuring revenue diversification with the Herfindahl\u2013Hirschman index (HHI), the results indicate that the more diversified the bank is, the more profitable it is.

CSR movement and CSR reportingpractices by financial sector have gathered great momentum in recent years. Banking sector is in the leading position in discharging CSR reporting.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The sample composed of all the 30 banking companies enlisted in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), and the study used content analysis approach for systematic categorization and analysis of the contents reported in the annual report. A total of 97 CSR items classified into seven classes were selected through a relevant literature review, as the expected itemsand average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, percentage and correlation, etc. were used as the tools of analysis. SPSS software version 19.0 was used to analyze the data. An ordinary least square (OLS) regression model is fitted to the data for assessing the effect of independent variables on total CSRreporting score.Findings \u2013 The study found that the extent of CSR reporting in banking companies in Bangladesh varies from 27.84 to 65.98 per cent, and on an average, they report 47.39 per cent of the expected CSR items in annual report. It is also observed that banking companies in Bangladesh emphasized onlinguistic or written form than charts, graphs or pictures in reporting CSR activities to their stakeholders, and the study found no significant influence of the selected bank characteristics on the extent of CSR reporting. Moreover, the study observed significant impact of regulatory change on nature and extent of CSR reporting.Research limitations/implications \u2013 The study considered all the listed commercial banking companies in Bangladesh, and the annual report of 2011 was taken as the main source of data.Social implications \u2013 Among others, the implications of the study include the following. Banking companies are expected to get a real scenario of CSR reporting of the banking sector in Bangladesh and banking companies with poor CSR contribution expected to be motivated for contributing more in CSRactivities. Government and other regulatory bodies can also get detailed information regarding CSR reporting practices for formulating guidelines in this regard.Originality/value \u2013 This empirical study on the determinants of extent of CSR reporting using a larger number of expected CSR items contributes toward a better understanding of the CSR reporting practices of the banking companies in Bangladesh. The study used a new independent variable \u201cCSR Expenditure\u201d in justifying its influence on CSR reporting and identified the impact of regulatory change on CSR reporting. The study expects contributing in the enactment of more regulatory requirements for bringing the CSR reporting into a certain framework and encouraging in more CSR reporting in Bangladesh.",

Further research investigating key determinants of compliance/non-compliance to the CCG is very crucial in understanding the context of compliance with CCG.\nPractical implications \u2013 Despite the evidence showing positive association between compliance with CCG and investor confidence, there is no evidence that Nigerian banks appreciate the value of such compliance. The results of this study imply a serious negative ramification on the compliance level with the Basel III and potential loss of confidence of international investors.\nOriginality/value \u2013 The essence of compliance to boosting investor confidence is paramount in emerging world particularly with the recent accounting scandals that reshape our views of various aspects of CG. No any framework for measuring compliance is in place by the central bank. Therefore this study establishes a pragmatic framework that will assess the degree of compliance by the Nigerian banks with a view to ensuring safeguard of the depositors\u2019 funds and re-building investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigerian financial system particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis that negatively affected banks across the globe. This measurement yardstick will also help in periodic assessment of compliance with other rules such Basel III.\nJEL Classification: DO4, FO1, F4, G2, G3",

        "publication title": "Does Regulatory Environment affect Earnings Management in Transitional Economies? An Empirical Examination of the Financial Reporting Quality of Cross-Listed Firms of China and Hong Kong",
        "abstract": "This paper provides evidence on the impact of regulatory environment on financial reporting quality of transitional economies. This study compares the financial reporting quality of Hong Kong firms which are cross-listed in mainland China with those of Hong Kong firms cross-listed in China using specific earnings management metrics (earnings smoothing, timely loss recognition, value relevance and managing towards earnings targets) under pre- and post-IFRS regimes.\n\nThe financial reporting quality of Chinese A-share companies and Hong Kong listed companies are examined using earnings management measures. Using 2007 as base year, the study used a cumulative of \u22125 and +5 years of convergence experience which provide a total of 3,000 firm-year observations. In addition to regression analyses, we used the difference-in-difference analysis to check for the impact of regulatory environments on earnings management.\n\nThrough the lens of contingency theory, our results indicate that the adoption of the new substantially IFRS-convergent accounting standards in China results in better financial reporting quality evidenced by less earning management. The empirical results further shows that accounting data are more value relevant for Hong Kong listed firms, and that firms listed in China are more likely to engage in accrual-based earnings management than in real earnings management activities. We established that different earnings management practices that are seemingly tolerable in one country may not be tolerable in another due to level of differences in the regulatory environments.\n\nThe findings show that Hong Kong listed companies\u2019 exhibit higher level of financial reporting quality than Chinese listed companies, which implies that the financial reporting quality under IFRS can be significantly different in regions with different institutional, economic and regulatory environments. The results imply that contingent factors such as country\u2019s institutional structures, its extent of regulation and the strength of its investor protection environments impact on financial reporting quality particularly in transitional and emerging economies. As such, these factors need to be given appropriate considerations by financial reporting regulators and policy-makers interested in controlling earnings management practices among their corporations.\n\nThis study is a high impact study considering that China plays a significant role in today\u2019s globalised economy. This study is unique as it the first, that we are aware of, to compare real earnings activities against accrual-based earnings management in pre- and post-IFRS adoption periods within the Chinese and Hong Kong financial reporting environments, distinguishing between cross-listed and non-cross-listed firms.\n\n",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of Exchange Rate Volatility (ERV) for Iceland, on tourist arrivals exports during the period of first quarter of 1990 to fourth quarter of 2014. It is claimed by some researchers that exchange rate volatility causes a reduction on tourist arrivals. Empirical researchers often utilize the standard deviation of the moving average of the logarithm of the exchange rate as a measure of exchange rate fluctuation. In this study, a new measure for measuring volatility is proposed. The empirical methodology used relies upon the theory of cointegration, error correction representation of the exchange rate volatility measures using the Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) modeling to cointegration. Overall, our findings suggest that there is a negative effect of volatility to tourists\u2019 arrivals for Iceland.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Armed conflict, and to a lesser extent terrorism, have detrimental effect on economic and social development through destruction of human and physical capital and ensuing disruption to economic activity. There is also likely to be an indirect effect of political instability through its impact on foreign aid. The net effect is not obvious; violence may discourage aid donors and hence lead to a fall in received aid on the one hand, but it may well lead to an increase in foreign aid as donors offer reimbursement for counterterrorism efforts on the other hand. This paper uses a panel of countries to identify the net effect of armed conflict and terrorism, both domestic and international, on aid receipts. It shows that armed conflict has a negative effect on the amounts of both bilateral and multilateral aid. It also finds that terrorism tends to increase foreign assistance. The effect is stronger for bilateral aid; this is consistent with the expectation that they are likely to use foreign aid to directly or indirectly assist governments fighting terrorism. Nonetheless, these results do not hold for Muslim countries which do not receive increased aid when suffering from terrorism.",

        "abstract": "We examine the financial decision and market valuation in mergers and acquisitions using a unique dataset of Chinese firms in the period of 2003\u20132010. Our results show that bidders\u2019 financial decisions are related to factors specific to the bidders, targets and deals, ownership structure and financial conditions.  State\u2013controlled bidding firms are less likely to use cash proceeds from stock issuance to finance mergers and acquisitions, suggesting that they are more concerned with the threat of resulting corporate control change, while executives prefer cash from debt issuance to avoid dilution of voting power. Bidders with huge cash reserves are less likely to opt for any form of stock financing, which is consistent with the view that cash\u2013rich bidders prefer internally generated funds to finance mergers and acquisitions. With regards to market performance, both cash and stock financed deals create value for bidding firms in the short\u2013term, while stock deals perform better than cash deals in the long\u2013term. Our further analyses show that market reactions differ in ways which suggest a difference in the market\u2019s assessment over financing decision when the deals are paid in cash, with deals involving seasoned equity offerings outperforming those paid by internal funds and debt. Our results highlight that market reactions to M&A deals financed by different sources in China differ from those in well-developed economies due to its distinctive institutional setup. ",

This paper attempts to identify which representations within the GARCH family of models can most efficiently deal with these issues. A number of different distributions (normal, Student t, GED and skewed Student) and different volatility of returns asymmetry representations (EGARCH and GJR- -GARCH) are examined. Our data set consists of daily Jordanian stock market returns over the period January 2000 \u2013 November 2014. Using both the Superior Predicative Ability (SPA) and Model Confidence Set (MCS) testing frameworks it is found that using GJR-GARCH with a skewed Student distribution most accurately and efficiently forecasts Jordanian market movements.

The empirical evidence is based on updated data from 52 African countries for the period 1996\u20132010. An endogeneity robust instrumental variable Two-Stage-Least Squares empirical strategy is employed. The findings reveal that development assistance deteriorates economic (regulation quality and government effectiveness) and institutional (corruption-control and rule of law) governance, but has an insignificant effect on political (political stability, voice and accountability) governance. While, these findings are broadly in accordance with Moyo and Collier on weak governance, they neither confirm the Eubank position on political governance nor the Asongu stance on the aid-corruption nexus in a debate with Okada and Samreth. The use of foreign aid as an instrument to influence the election and replacement of political leaders in Africa may have insignificant results. It is time to solve the second tragedy of foreign aid and that economists and policy makers start rethinking the models and theories on which foreign aid is used to influence economic, institutional and political governance in recipient countries.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the relationship between market structure and ex- pected stock returns in the London Stock Exchange during 1985 and 2010. Using Fama- MacBeth regressions, we find that industry concentration is negatively related to average stock returns, even after controlling for beta, size, book-to-market equity, momentum, and leverage. In addition, there is a strong evidence of a growth effect. Firms or industry portfolios with smaller book-to-market ratios have significantly higher returns. In contrast, beta is never statistically significant. The above results are robust to firm- and industry- level regressions, and the formation of firms into 100 size-beta portfolios. Our findings indicate that competitive industries earn, on average, higher risk-adjusted returns than concentrated industries. An explanation is that investors in more competitive industries require larger premiums for greater distress risks associated with these industries. Our paper is one of the first to link market competition with the average stock returns in the UK, and contributes to the asset pricing literature by extending the evidence from the US to another important financial market.",

Drawing upon data obtained in a survey of clients of five microfinance institutions, this paper extends the discussion on microfinance by examining the impact of microfinance on poverty in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The study examines the extent to which microfinance institutions reach the poor and investigates the factors influencing participation in microfinance programmes. In addition, the study employs a propensity score matching model (PSM) to ascertain the poverty-reducing effects of participation in microfinance programmes. The empirical results shows that microfinance institutions reach more of the less poor households than the very poor households. Again, socio-economic characteristics such as gender (i.e. being a female), literacy, child dependency ratio and landholdings were found to have significant influence on the likelihood of participating in microfinance programmes. In general, the results did not show significant effect microfinance on poverty reduction. However, if we consider the effects of microfinance on poverty across sub-groups under poverty groupings, significant poverty-reducing effect of microfinance was observed for the very poor households while for the less poor the effect was not statistically significant.",

Moreover, the gap between the debt in a single member country and its union average turns out to be a key element, more than the level of debt itself.

It is shown that all the contradictions that arise contain the knowledge operator K. Thus, the contradictions do not refer purely to material objects, and do not imply the existence of inconsistent, concrete, physical objects, or the inconsistency of direct sensory experience. However, the decision-making of rational self-interested agents is stymied by the appearance of such intensional contradictions. Replacing the rational self-interest axioms with axioms for an appropriate moral framework removes the inconsistencies.

Elevated values of these two linguistic variables, however, are not symptomatic of exacerbated risk. Consequently, investors are advised to peruse annual report narratives, as they contain valuable information that may not yet have been discounted in the prices.Publisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Accounting Forum.

        "abstract": "Purpose\u2013 The purpose of this paper is to focus on the weak-form efficiency of 24 emerging and nine industrial stock market indices around the world. It tests for the predictability and the presence of seasonal patterns in rates of return from January 2000 to December 2010.Design/methodology/approach\u2013 It reports on the descriptive statistics for estimated monthly percentage returns. This is complemented by the use of both parametric and non-parametric techniques to test for abnormal return behaviour in stock markets.Findings\u2013 The results show that: first, emerging economies which persisted with market-oriented reforms had higher returns relative to risk, indicating their attractiveness for risk diversification; second, successive changes in stock prices were interrelated with each other and therefore contained information for predicting future prices in two-thirds of the emerging markets compared to one-third of industrial economies; and third, the turn-of-the calendar year effect was present for half of the emerging markets vis-\u00e0-vis one-quarter of the developed countries. The authors found limited support for the tax-loss selling hypothesis for both the emerging and industrial economies.Research limitations/implications\u2013 The paper fails to specifically analyse the implications for security returns of changes in technology, institutions, volume of trading and regulations in the different stock markets.Practical implications\u2013 The results should be particularly informative for foreign investors with regard to the risk diversification benefits of the various emerging and industrialised stock markets and the expected risk-return trade-offs.Originality/value\u2013 The paper provides a more powerful explanation for the role of institutional arrangements, infrastructure, culture and other country-specific risk factors in asset pricing compared to disparate case studies.",

We find that market reactions are far stronger for negative events on the inferior ratings and for positive events on the superior ratings. Such evidence suggests aversion of market participants to the ambiguity inherent in split ratings. Sovereign credit spreads are particularly responsive to negative events by S&P (the more conservative agency in the sample). Moody's positive events have a significant impact only when Moody's assigns superior pre-event ratings compared with S&P. There is little evidence that split ratings involving Fitch have any market implication.",

        "abstract": "This article investigates how the duration of a regime (i.e., the length of stability) affects the likelihood of a permanent structural break by devising the duration dependence in structural break method, which combines a structural break test and a duration dependence test. First, the locations of structural breaks are identified by Bai and Perron\u2019s (1998) method. Then, it is estimated how a hazard rate changes in duration between structural breaks by parametric duration analysis using the Weibull and the log-logistic hazard functions. This study reveals the evidence of positive duration dependence, that is, stability is destabilizing, in 13 out of 27 international stock indices and the pooled data. In other words, as one regime continues over time with unchanged parameter values, a new structural break is more likely to occur. This method discloses a lower degree of duration dependence than the duration-dependence Markov-switching model (Durland and McCurdy, 1994) that considers temporary switches between a limited number of regimes. Also, some new patterns are emerged, e.g., more predominant positive duration dependence in bear markets, the secondary stock exchanges of a country and developing countries.Publisher statement: This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Applied Economics on 28th November 2014, available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2014.985370 .",

        "abstract": "HIV/AIDS compared to the rest of the word. This paper analyses the long-term economic effects of HIV/AIDS using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Taking Uganda as a case study for analysis, the paper aims to predict the economic impact of HIV/AIDS through: (i) the human resource channel and, (ii) the source of fiscal space for HIV/AIDS channel, and proposes policy options for funding HIV interventions in the long-term. The paper shows that if the government intervenes by scaling up treatment and prevention of HIV, the negative economic impacts of HIV/AIDS \u2013 including the soaring cost of production due to rising wages, declining GDP growth rates relative to the base, and the rising domestic debt as share of GDP \u2013 are reversed. The economy thrives from a growing labour force supply and resource flows to HIV interventions. Foreign-aid and direct taxation are both potential sources of fiscal space for HIV albeit with differential impacts on sectoral growth and government debt levels. The study demonstrates that low-income-countries (LICs) like Uganda have the capacity to mobilise domestic resources to fund HIV interventions by increasing revenues from direct taxes. It is recommended that policymakers \u2013 in Uganda and other LICs grappling with similar challenges \u2013 devise means to increase revenue from direct taxes particularly by tapping into the large informal sector. The paper also proposes that in the short to medium term, development-aid for health be increased in order for government to meet the future HIV/AIDS obligations. Overall, the research findings strengthen the case for policy makers to frontload investment in HIV treatment and prevention.",

In addition to the standard deviation of moving average of the logarithm of the exchange rate, a new measure capturing unexpected fluctuation of the exchange rate is examined using the autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) modelling for co-integration.

In this study, we examine the relationship between tourist arrivals and ERV for the UK and Sweden. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between ERV and tourist flows into the two countries suggesting that potential travellers and tour operators react to changes of the exchange rate. Direct policy implications are: policy makers should consider the effects of ERV when designing tourism policy, i.e. countries with substantial tourist inflows from a diversified range of international markets should avoid the opening up of markets that may be exposed to disturbances that could result to ERV. Further, a country relying heavily on its tourism industry, should avoid using exchange rate policies in order to correct its international competiveness, as these policies may end up to an ERV that could reduce substantially its tourism inflows.",

We tested the Trade-off theory and the pecking order theory and the relevance of these theories to Nigerian firms is confirmed. The speed of adjustment to the target capital structure is determined using both pool OLS and GMM to ensure the robustness of the finding. The descriptive statistics show that leverage constitute 63% of the capital structure of Nigerian firms, while leverage is dominated with the short term leverage. We observed that profitability and asset structure were negatively related to leverage while the size of the firm and non-debt tax shield were positively related to leverage. The adjustment speed of Nigerian firms is very high 47% that compares well with studies on non-financial firms done in most developed countries.",

This note extends what we know on this nexus in a threefold manner: namely, in terms of: incremental, lifelong learning and synergy effects. Four main findings are established. First, education is a powerful tool in the fight against corruption. Second, there is evidence of an incremental effect in the transition from secondary to tertiary education. Third, lifelong learning defined as knowledge acquired during primary, secondary and tertiary education negatively affects corruption. Fourth, there is evidence of a \u2018synergy effect\u2019 because the impact of lifelong learning is higher than the combined effects of various educational levels. The empirical evidence is based on 53 African countries for the period 1996-2010. Two main policy implications are derived. First, encouraging education through the tertiary level enhances the fight against corruption. Second, the drive towards a knowledge economy by means of lifelong learning has \u2018corruption mitigating\u2019 benefits.",

        "abstract": "Islamic banks have access to only short-dated funding sources resulting in asset liability mismatches when financing assets with longer maturities. Maturity mismatches give rise to a risk that an unexpected increase in the cost of refinancing liabilities as they mature will not be offset by corresponding asset returns. Exposure to refinancing risk is exacerbated by paying returns to providers of off balance sheet funds which do not covary with the returns of corresponding assets as they would from a stricter application of shariah principles underlying these funding structures. The active hedging of refinancing risk by Islamic banks is also challenged due to a lack of suitable hedging instruments as well as to differing shariah opinions concerning their permissibility. As an alternative to risk transference through hedging, this paper develops a framework to quantify a reserve to instead absorb refinancing risk which is distinguished from reserves already in use by Islamic banks, namely the investment risk and profit equalisation reserves.",

Our article aims to contribute to the empirical literature by exploring the efficiency of these   indices   and   their   potential   for   diversification   in   comparison   with   the   conventional benchmarks. We explore the existence of diversification opportunities by studying whether indices are  cointegrated  or  not.  Then,  the  weak-form  efficiency  level  is  analyzed  by  testing  the  random walk hypothesis using variance ratio tests. Our sample includes Islamic and mainstream indices of four  indices  families; among  them,  two  Shariah-compliant  indices  which  have  not  been  studied before  in  the  academic  literature. Our  results  show  that  Islamic  indices  have  the  same  level  of (in) efficiency as conventional ones, the indices of MSCI and FTSE families are the less inefficient. In terms of cointegration analysis, Islamic indices of Dow Jones and S&P have no cointegrating relations with their respective   benchmarks, which suggests the   existence   of   long-run diversification opportunities.\n",

        "abstract": "Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) currently constitutes the main mechanism for economic globalisation. Despite the rising integration of the Turkish economy into the global economy, FDI performance of Turkey remained lower than many other developing countries until the early 2000s. This was followed by a period of a boom in which Turkey attracted record levels of FDI inflows in her history. Accompanying these inflows, the country also achieved high rates of growth. However, high unemployment rates continued to be a major problem. This chapter seeks to explain the role of FDI inflows in job creation in Turkey at a sectoral level for the period 2000\u20132008. We use panel data analysis and find a positive, but weak relationship between FDI inflows and employment. Merger and acquisitions, as the dominant mode of foreign entry in Turkey, and/or the dominance of the FDI inflows in the financial sector after 2004 might be the reasons for this weak employment effect. Moreover, the tendency for the shift of foreign investment from low-tech to medium-and high-tech industries in Turkish manufacturing could lead to the negligible effect on employment.",

We contribute to the literature by exploring whether a direct measure of mood explains the Monday effect. In line with psychological literature, a greater proportion of investors are more pessimistic in the early days of the week, and become more optimistic as the week progresses. We use novel daily mood data from Facebook across 20 international markets to explore the impact of mood on the Monday anomaly. We find that the Monday effect disappears after controlling for mood. In line with our hypothesis that mood drives the Monday effect, we find that the effect is more prominent within small capitalization indices and within collectivist and high-uncertainty-avoidance countries. Investors could consider mood levels to forecast Mondays with more (less) pronounced negative returns.",

        "abstract": "The paper examines the economic effects of expected changes in temperatures and precipitation on the trade of ten major food crops. The relative effects for developing versus developed countries are emphasized. A series of econometric models using panel data and autoregressive integrated moving average models are used to estimate and forecast relationships between yields and weather data, the results of which are used as input into MAGNET, a global computerized general equilibrium modeling framework. Econometric results show that average temperatures have increased across all areas growing major food crops. Results for precipitation are ambiguous, however, there is statistical evidence of two distinct periods, a first in which, on average, precipitation fell, followed by a second in which it increased. Results for crops with statistically significant estimates show that increasing temperatures have negatively affected yields.These results hold for both poor and rich countries, however, the degree to which yields are reduced is crop specific and sensitive to a country\u2019s level of wealth. MAGNET results show that changes in weather are likely to have significant effects on the production, trade, and, in some cases, the consumption of major food crops.  ",

The analysis is based on a general empirical location model that captures interactions between region and sector characteristics in determining production location, and data on pig production in 43 European regions.

In some European countries there have been episodes of fiscal retrenchments followed by an increase in output (Sweden, Ireland, Denmark, and Finland). These have been taken as a starting point for theories advocating, contrary to the Keynesian tradition, the possibility of a negative sign of the fiscal multiplier. We show that expansionary fiscal consolidations can occur under extreme circumstances: they are not the result of pure fiscal policies, but rather they result from a policy mix in which the central bank's behaviour is crucial. On the basis of this evidence we discuss why, given the current economic scenario, immediate austerity cannot be a plausible way out from the recession in the euro-area countries.",

        "abstract": "Studies of the 2007-09 credit crisis and the resulting recession have revealed the inadequacy of the predominant theoretical frameworks and their failure to propose adequate policy solutions. The presence in the economy of \u201cbank money\u201d and a financial system (not only constituted by banks) characterized by financial innovation and speculation fundamentally changes the nature of credit creation. As J.A. Schumpeter (1934) and other scholars (such as Shackle, 1967) have recognized the central role of credit creation in the economic system, a new perspective on the financial role in defining the growth path needs to be developed by filling the gaps in New Growth Theory (NGT) (Aghion and Howitt, 1998) and Evolutionary Theory (ET) (Nelson and Winter, 1982) - which we call the two Sons of Schumpeter - and in some way combining them. The financial instability of the economy seems to depend on the financial structure. The goal of this survey is to explain the main hypothesis of the historical passage of the economy from a virtuous to a bad cycle and to show the existence of what we label the wealth trap: that is, the consequence of the presence of a technologically advanced and greedy financial system within the economic system. This new point of view can help to answer some important questions that in the literature remain unsolved. Future extensions of this survey will develop a quantitative ABM (Agent-Based Model) able to demonstrate the existence of the \u201ctwo cycles\u201d and will finally undertake experiments to build policy proposals for the restoration of the virtuous cycle and to prevent this cycle from becoming a bad one again.",

        "abstract": "Principal Insurance Holdings Limited was the first dedicated, stand alone Islamic insurance provider in the UK. The company received Financial Service Authority authorisation in May 2008 and raised in excess of \u00a360 million of capital. The shareholders were institutional and private investors predominantly from Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Islamic insurance was launched as a new consumer brand known as Salaam Halal insurance (Salaam).However, not long after the launch of Salaam in 2008, the company closed to new business in November 2009 with the Chief Executive stating that \u2018we are in a period of solvent run-off, which means that while we continue to offer existing policyholders our full support, we are not providing any further policies to new or existing customers at this time\u2019.   The reasons provided for the closure of Salaam were that the company had failed to raise sufficient capital to continue trading. The purpose of this paper was to use Salaam as a case study and investigate the reasons as to what contributed towards its demise. An analysis of questionnaires as well financial data was conducted to determine what led to the failure of Salaam.Our research indicated that a combination of both internal and external factors led to the demise of Salaam. Internal factors consisted of under-pricing, poor underwriting, inadequate cost control, poor management and absence of re-takaful. Whilst external factors included an erroneous time to enter the insurance market as it coincided with the financial crises which made raising additional capital very difficult for Salaam.",

It pools data from 426 institutions in 41 developing countries from 2004 to 2008. Contrary to expectations, the results of an ordered-logistic regression strongly support an inverted U-shaped function for the relationship between interest rates and sustainability, irrespective of customer orientation. Additionally, a shift away from the poorest borrowers in the low-end market does not significantly improve the likelihood of being more profitable after controlling for other relevant covariates. MFIs may not, therefore, be forced to drift away from their original goal of serving the underprivileged in pursuit of financial viability.",

We provide evidence consistent with the wealth effect as a source of contagion for the majority of countries. Nevertheless, we uncover evidence of investor induced contagion sourced by the portfolio rebalancing effect for correlations involving Spanish and Italian bonds during the debt crisis. Further, we find that tight (narrow) credit spreads reduce (magnify) the wealth and portfolio rebalancing effects, which are offset by the opposite effects of risk aversion amongst investors, a dynamic that is not restricted to crisis periods.",

Our main findings are as follows. First, by distinguishing between conventional and Islamic stock market indices, we find that these two groups of investments react heterogeneously to the recent political turmoil. Specifically, we document a significant increase in the volatility of Islamic indices during the period of political unrests whereas the uprisings have had little or no significant effect on the volatility in conventional markets. Such difference is confirmed by further analysis in a multivariate GARCH model. Second, regardless of its impact on volatility, there is little evidence to suggest that MENA markets have become more integrated with international markets after the political revolution. Third, similar results are not found for the benchmark indices which indicate that the changes are the result of political tensions. In general, these results are robust to model specification and consistent with the notion that political uncertainty contributes to financial volatility. Overall, the findings are important in understanding the role of political uncertainty on stock market stability and are of great significance to investors and market regulators.",

This paper finds that stock liquidity helps improve investment efficiency, mitigating both overinvestment and underinvestment. This finding is robust to numerous sensitivity analyses, including controls for endogeneity and for the other known determinants of investment efficiency, the choice of the measure of stock liquidity and investment efficiency. Further analysis shows that stock liquidity improves corporate capital allocation efficiency by reducing agency costs and increasing the information content of share prices.",

The use of the three estimation method is in order to make a meaningful comparison between the models.Findings\u2013 The findings indicate that there are similarities and differences in the capital structure determinants on the two sets of firms: banks tend to be more leveraged when they are more profitable and manufacturing firms tend to be less leveraged when they are profitable. In addition, banks adjust their leverage faster at a speed of 69 per cent than manufacturing firms at 46 per cent. The study also shows that changes in the economy influence the capital structure of financial firms more than that of manufacturing firms.Research limitations/implications\u2013 The study only focused on one economy.Practical implications\u2013 As a result of 2008 global financial crisis, there has been intense debate on the significance of regulatory capital.

        "abstract": "My research concerns Chinese students\u2019 perceptions of humour in British academic lectures. It suggests that this neglected dimension of the experience of Chinese international students in Britain is significant for both their personal well-being and educational outcomes.In the course of my research, nine academic lectures with a total duration of 12 hours and 50 minutes were recorded in two university departments in England. Interviews and group discussions were conducted with 39 Chinese students who attended these lectures regarding potential humour they perceived in the lectures. The lecturers of these lectures were also interviewed. Data analysis shows that many of the Chinese participants encountered difficulty at various levels in understanding humour in the lectures. In many cases they attributed the lack of comprehension to their language problems in a conventional sense, e.g. in relation to vocabulary, speech speed and accents, but they seldom referred to difficulty caused by cultural allusions within the humour. Some participants claimed that \u2018British humour\u2019 was particularly perplexing, but there is recurring evidence in my data showing similarities between the lecturers\u2019 and the Chinese participants\u2019 humour, challenging the latter group\u2019s accounts of the inherent difference between humour in the two cultures they represent.Various studies have reported a particular pattern of socialisation of Chinese students in the U.K.: Chinese students experience much less interaction with British people than they expect, and fall into the habit of stereotyping British people and themselves. In my study, the Chinese students\u2019 discrimination between two national categories of humour may be seen as an example of this habit in action. In my presentation, I will argue that this habit presents clear dangers, and that the students\u2019 tendency to stereotype and to auto-stereotype is an issue requiring further academic attention.",

They can also have another indirect effect through their impact on aid, but the likely net effect is not obvious. The impact on the economy and polity may well discourage aid donors and lead to a reduction in aid. On the other hand donors may provide aid as a reimbursement for counter-terrorist efforts that benefit the donor country. This paper tries to identify the net effect using a panel of countries. It finds that armed conflict does have a large and negative effect on both multilateral and bilateral aid, but that bilateral donors also seem to turn a blind eye to violence in oil exporting countries. It also finds that while international terrorism tends to increase bilateral aid, bilateral donors seem indifferent to domestic terrorism. In contrast, multilateral aid is found not to react to international terrorism, but does react to its domestic terrorism.",

Using a survey approach, the respondents, who were company executives and non-executive directors with knowledge of the Ghanaian Code and its provisions, regard the code as a benchmark for good corporate governance practices within Ghanaian listed firms. They also report some improvement in the standard of corporate governance in their companies since the introduction of the Code. Many of the company directors indicated their preparedness to comply with further corporate governance requirements, such as the adoption of a formal nomination committee something not been currently included in the Ghanaian Code. However, the directors noted that they receive inadequate support from the regulatory and institutional bodies for the implementation of the Ghanaian Code provisions. Many of the directors also supported the review of the Ghanaian Code by an independent committee. With regard to the adoption of the Ghanaian Code and its influence on firm performance, the respondents indicated that the adoption of the specific governance provisions in the area of chief executive officer (CEO)/chairman roles separation, having a balance of executive and non-executive directors on the board, the establishment of audit and remuneration committees, and the full adoption of the Ghanaian Code provisions were all influential in determining firm performance. They, however, did not support the adoption of the board size provision as influential to firm performance. This raises questions about the usefulness of the range of board size as recommended by the Ghanaian Code.",

For example, the enactment of The Sarbanes Oxley Act (2002), while purportedly aimed at improving audit and statutory reporting quality, has been marred by a series of unexpected shortcomings that have undermined the original intention of the legislators. This research uses a discursive critical style to explore possible tensions between current audit practice and the Protection of Information Bill (2011) as a South Africa-specific example of unforeseen implications of proposed legislation. At the same time, the research points to the relevance of political power when examining policy developments in a modern or post-modern society.",

        "abstract": "While the relationship between state ownership and firm performance has been widely researched, the empirical evidence has provided mixed results. This study applies panel data regression techniques to 10,639 firm-year observations of non-financial Chinese listed firms during 2003\u20132010 to examine the relationship between state ownership and firm performance. The results show that state ownership has a U-shaped relationship with firm performance. The Split Share Structure Reform in 2005\u20132006 played a positive role in enhancing the relationship between state ownership and firm profitability ratios. Although state ownership decreased significantly after 2006, it remains high in strategically important industry sectors such as the oil, natural gas and mining sector and the publishing, broadcasting and media sector. The findings reveal that a higher level of state ownership is superior to a dispersed ownership structure due to the benefits of government support and political connections. The Split Share Structure Reform made previously non-tradable shares legally tradable, improving corporate governance and reducing the negative effect of non-tradable state shares.\n\nPublisher statement: This is an Open Access report distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/), which permits users to copy, distribute and transmit the work for non-commercial purposes providing it is properly cited.",

        "abstract": "The recent spate of strikes in the mining sector in South Africa has created a perceived nervousness amongst shareholders. Within the mining sector in South Africa, gold mining is of significance historically and economically. This study aims to assess the impact of strikes on shareholder value in the gold mining industry during the period beginning January 2007 and December 2012, and uses the popular event study methodology developed by Ball and Brown (1968). The effect of the announcement and duration of the strike on the share price was tested. Significant negative cumulative abnormal returns were observed during the announcement of the strike. The impact of the announcement of protected strikes compared to unprotected strikes on the share price was compared. Although both types of strikes had a negative impact on shareholder value, an unprotected strike had less of an impact on shareholder value compared to a protected strike. This observation is of particular significance given the recent increase in unprotected strikes. Strikes with a duration of 15 days or longer resulted in smaller negative cumulative abnormal returns as opposed to strikes which lasted for less than 15 days.",

        "abstract": "Many global cities are poorly configured to cope with population shifts, climate change and peak oil. Transport-oriented development (TOD) could help reconfigure cities towards sustainability. TOD projects have dual logistical and place-enhancement functions however, and this ambiguity carries over to form and extent. The allocation, coordination and construction of multiple projects to revamp, connect and beautify can be contentious, complex and expensive. Planning regimes are usually conservative, and have competing objectives and dislocated organisational architectures. The consequence is often high-risk. The resolution to functional, financial and institutional TOD dispute is de-risking in two modes. In Mode 1, developers and government agencies remain separate but collaborate on an ad hoc basis, contaminated by uplift advocacy. In Mode 2, a Special Purpose Vehicle is formally constituted and risks are distributed more transparently. Given transport and financial constraints in many regional cities, Mode 2, or a public-private TOD partnership (PPP), is appealing but not without danger. PPPs are prone to agency problems while, empirically, their cost-effectiveness track record is mixed. Whatever the mode, coherent spatial development requires cooperation for efficient use of resources.",

A thorough literature review was undertaken to achieve the paper\u2019s aim. The secondary data used in this paper was obtained from different databases like Ebscohost, Business Search Premier, Academic Search Premier, Emerlad, Sciencedirect, and Jstor. The current paper suggests a new approach and way of thinking for external auditors that might help them in spotting the difference between earnings management and fraud. This new approach calls for the importance of considering management\u2019s motives which is the main driver for all fraudulent activities. A set of recommendations for external auditors, researchers, and standards\u2019 setters are provided in this paper. External auditors have to view external auditing in terms of the audit of motivations. Standards\u2019 setters should provide external auditors with more guidelines regarding the audit of management\u2019s motives. More research is still needed in management\u2019s motives and integrity.",

In response to these concerns, auditing standards setters have issued fraud standards that have expanded what is required of the external auditors in relation to fraud detection. However, regardless of these efforts, academic research studies indicate that more efforts are still needed from audit regulators and external auditors. The current paper provides insights into two areas. Firstly, it explores the reasons behind the audit expectation gap, and secondly, it assesses the efforts of standards\u2019 setters and external auditors to narrow the gap in relation to fraud detection.

Park visitors were conveniently sampled through an intercept survey method form. Taman Sri Nibong Park is one of the biggest neighborhood parks in Pulau Pinang. A total of 173 questionnaires were returned. The data were analyzed through the use of descriptive statistics.FindingsBy knowing the needs and preferences of visitors and neighborhood residents, the present study concludes that more efforts should be made to include certain qualities in designing neighborhood areas to attract more visitors and investors. Related to the effectiveness of design on park users' perceptions and preferences, this study as well as observations has found that park users perceive some elements of environmental design, like physical barriers of fences and hedges between playground and the football field, effective in protecting users from accident and injury in the park. Another suggestion, which users made was for more supervisors to be in the park or playground to take care of the children while they use the equipment.Research limitations/implicationsThe current study is limited in its scope because of the need to complete the study within a limited time and budget. Future studies are needed to explore how design strategies of Neighborhood Parks can satisfy urban neighborhood populations and also support social business development. The directions for future research are identified as more research should be conducted in this regard and more neighborhood parks should be considered allowing for comparison among them.Practical implicationsThis research would enable landscape architects and environmental designers as well as business and community developers to match specific developmental goals of urban neighborhood environmental planning. It can influence business strategies to attract more investment by the community developer, and also this new approach can influence the future of the society and its sustainability.Originality/valueThe paper challenges the traditional view of parks as places that only incur social expense to a new perception that views them as revenue and social business places.",

The study results are based on data collected from 100 universities in UK adapted from the Times Good University Guide 2004. Based on nine hypotheses, the study develops a model of entry standards to UK universities. To test the research hypotheses and predict the determinants of the UK universities entry standards, the OLS (Ordinary Least Square) regression is used. The findings of the study indicate that four hypotheses are supported, where a positive association was found between entry standards and the research assessment, first upper second, destination after graduation and efficiency of the study. The other internal capabilities were not found associated with the entry standards including the teaching assessment, staff/student ratio, library/computing and facilities spending, and the age of the university. The study implies that the reputation and the individual aspiration factors as the main predicators for higher entry standards. Implications for some UK universities are included. ",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of non-audit services on auditor independence in the regime following the 2004 introduction of new regulations, in the form of Ethical Standards for auditors in the United Kingdom. Employing three different measures of the auditor\u2019s economic dependence on clients, the study finds evidence in support of the hypothesized link between two of the three measures and discretionary accruals in reporting companies. Extending the investigation, the study also tests whether a threshold level for the relative amounts of audit and non-audit service fees can distinguish between the circumstances when independence may be weakened and when it is not. The results reveal evidence of higher discretionary accruals when the level of non-audit service fees reaches a level of 150% of audit fees but that this relationship is not present when the level rises above 200%, suggesting that auditors may be more conscious of the potential threats to perceived independence when NAS reach this higher level. The study thus provides some evidence in support of the hypothesis that higher NAS fees and total fees to the auditor are positively correlated with the magnitude of discretionary accruals, but also that this relationship is more complicated than implied by a linear regression. The findings add to those of prior studies which have employed accruals based measures of audit quality to test the effect of joint audit and non-audit service provision. The paper also makes a contribution to the continuing policy debate over joint provision reflected in consultations and commentaries on regulation in this area such as the European Commission 2011 proposals for a ban on NAS provision to public interest entity audit clients in Europe and similar discussion in the 2009 report of the UK parliamentary Treasury Select Committee.

Its remarkable growth was driven by cheap labour and foreign investmentwhich became frenzied.1 The crisis exposed the Emirate\u2019s vulnerability. Historically, Dubai prospered at the expense of its regional and United Arab Emirates (UAE) competitors. It largely avoided the interventionist mistakes of Lingah, in Iran, or those of its neighbour, Sharjah.2 In the nineteenth century its wealth was derived from pearling but after the 1960s oil provided the money for some astute investments such as Jebel Ali port. Noteworthy Emirati commercial icons today include Emirates Airlines and Dubai Ports World. Some credit Dubai success to its relatively progressive regime which certainly compares favourably with the dismal performance of many of its Middle Eastern Arab peers.3 Dubai successfully harnessed a diverse workforce \u2013 a seemingly incongruous mix of Arabs, South Asians, Persians and Westerners. After 1990, it re-configured its affluence around real estate, tourism and financial services which supplement its flourishing re-export business. Cheap money, ambitious growth plans and loose immigration restrictions primed real estate speculation in Dubai. The catalyst for its property price bubble was the promulgation in 2002 of a new law to allow selective foreign property ownership.4 Dubai became a conduit for international and regional oil liquidity from soaring Gulf oil exports. By July 2008, relentless global industrial growth had pushed oil prices to US$147 per barrel. As with most bubbles, spin prolonged irrational exuberance.5 Dubai\u2019s rulers promulgated a string of at first only grandiose but later superlative and even phantasmagorial projects such as the world\u2019s tallest tower. Cheap credit, funnelled through Dubai\u2019s poorly regulated banks, financed these construction fantasies but, by 2007, the debt binge had become unsustainable. Credit was growing at almost 50 percent annually. Then, in October 2008, equity markets crashed. The global recession hit Dubai hard in the short term but Abu Dhabi\u2019s reserves and its geo-strategic location cushion it from the worst consequences of any economic folly.",

It introduces several extensions to an article by Enders and Sandler (2006), for instance it uses two independent datasets and presents an alternative approach to the events in Iraq. The differences in results between this paper and Enders and Sandler (2006) are caused by the lack of consistency in employing the World Bank\u2019s income classification by the two authors. This study finds that the rise of fundamentalist terrorism brought increases across all countries, while the post-Cold War era resulted in a reduction in attacks only in high and medium income countries. 9/11 appeared to have had no long lasting impact on distribution of terrorism, while the Iraq invasion seemed to have reduced international terrorism in rich states.",

We elaborated the data relative to the arrivals and presences of Italians and foreigners from 1990 to 2008 to obtain the parameters of the index of tourism density TD and of tourism significance TS for the new Forte-Mantovani tourism development Index, which consists of the arithmetic media of the two index. Taking Italy as a base and comparing the index of tourism development of the provinces of Ragusa and of Sicily, the variables which have influenced the national dynamic have been eliminated from the tourism dynamics of the two communities taken into consideration. A different development of tourism in the province of Ragusa has resulted in respect to Sicily, using Italy as a base, which would not be explainable without the Montalbano effect. Ragusan tourism resists better to the period of crises, because in the fashion cycle of tourism it has become a \u201cclassi-cal product\u201d. The research has also taken into consideration the new regional promotion policies of tourism through the film loca-tion.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of the paper: In 2001, a new legislative reform that governs the work of private universities in Syria took place. Since that time, competition in the Syrian higher education market became more apparent in both public and private sectors, and for the first time the concept of student as customer became much more popular in the higher education sector. Within the cooperation between the Syrian Government and the European Commission and with a budget of over 14 million Euros, the Higher Institute for Business Administration (HIBA) was founded in 2002. This institution is officially considered as the only public business school in Syria, and since its establishment, it attracted many students for both postgraduate and undergraduate. This study aims at identifying the determinants of customer (student)\u2019 satisfaction at HIBA for MBA and EMBA students.Design, methodology and approach: Using a quantitative survey of 52 factors quoted from a study done by Douglas et al (2006) and divided into 7Ps according to Ivy (2008) marketing mix model for business schools, both customer expectations and satisfactions were measured.Findings: For 55 MBA and EMBA students who participated in the study, the descriptive analysis show that students' expectations were high before registering at HIBA, however, during the actual experience of the course, students\u2019 satisfaction diminished. T-test and one way ANOVA showed that there is some variance between feelings of satisfaction for different groups.",

        "abstract": "Some academics have suggested that stock market risk increases as the investment horizon lengthens thus refuting the concept of time diversification. That argument has been based on an apparent increase in the cost of hedging stock price risk as indicated by theoretical put-option prices, which appear to increase when the investment horizon extends. The present article argues that those views are based on a restrictive use of the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing model. When the model is used less restrictively, put-option prices are found to decrease as the investment horizon lengthens so long as investment growth is sufficiently high and/or volatility is sufficiently low. Risk, as measured by the cost of hedging, may decline as the holding period lengthens. Dependent upon expected investment growth and volatility, option theory supports time diversification rather than refuting it.One implication is that index funds may be more likely to provide time diversification than actively managed funds. Index funds offer higher returns because of their lower costs, and offer lower volatility because of the absence of active risk.",

The study results are based on data collected from 100 universities in UK for the period from 1999 until 2002. Based on nine hypotheses, the study develops a model of entry standards to UK universities. To test the research hypotheses and predict the determinants of the UK universities entry standards, the OLS (Ordinary Least Square) regression is used. The findings of the study indicate that four hypotheses are supported, where a positive association was found between entry standards and the research assessment, first upper second, destination after graduation and efficiency of the study. The other internal capabilities were not found associated with the entry standards including the teaching assessment, staff/student ratio, library/computing and facilities spending, and the age of the university. The study implies that the reputation and the individual aspiration factors as the main predicators for higher entry standards. Implications for some UK universities are included.  ",

        "abstract": "CSR is as an emerging concept in the Syrian business society. In order to study CSR in Syria, the two dimensional model of Quazi and Brien (2000) was developed and tested. The model of Quazi and O\u2019Brien suggests that CSR falls between  two extremes: one that of the classical models that relates CSR to profit maximization which  makes it of a  narrow focus of the role of business in modern society while the second  extreme  or  the second group of models see business as a part of the  social matrix contributing to the welfare of society  and announces CSR  as a part of the greater society , pointing out to responsibilities that goes beyond the narrow perspective of profit maximization in the short term (Quazi and Brien, 2000). Different studies have used and developed Quazi and Brien\u2019s (2000) model in different country context, (see Jamali and Sidani (2008)). This study investigates how Syrian businesses might fall between the two extremes of the CSR perspective (the horizontal axis of Quazi and Brien\u2019s model) and the two extremes of the marketing motivations of CSR (a new dimension suggested by the study). Using a data set of 72 companies from Damascus, Aleppo, and Dair Ezzor and utilising factor and cluster analysis, the data set and analysis results prove the validity of the model and suggest Syrian businessmen and manages could be classified into two groups according to their CSR perspectives and their marketing motivations. Both these groups have around the same perspectives regarding CSR. The group of majority, however, does not perceive CSR marketing incentives.",

        "publication title": "The evolution of residential property price premia in a metropolis: Reconstitution or contamination?",
        "abstract": "Residential property price premia (\u2018premia\u2019) have long fascinated investors, particularly in times of euphoria, but their social, climatic and urban ramifications are much wider. A proper understanding of premia is hindered by the variety of exogenous influences determining them. They occur within idiosyncratic, complex, and continuously reconfiguring metropoli, conditioned by topography, history, regime, commerce, and culture. Given imperfectly competitive housing markets, conventional explanations for premia are either restricted to their financial dissection, trawl though metrics or cast around for hedonic coefficients. However, premia illuminate affordability and other problems in the broader planning and social debate. With the general significance of premia clarified, the research question of the project becomes: \u2018What drives residential property price premium evolution in a metropolis?\u2019 A complete answer involves dissecting the nature and establishing the location of putative premia and disentangling the influence and interactions of their various price drivers. To provide it, the project conducts a property and urban literature review. Based on theory\u2019s insight that higher order contains lower order systems, it develops and investigates a general systems model of residential premia with two modes. The system is conditioned by ideology but forced by population and capital inflows. Within it, premia mutate, influenced by a nested hierarchy of more or less contaminated information. To investigate the model and its different modes, the project employs tests across system pointers, at the macro, meso (all urban) and micro spatial resolutions. First, the turbulence and permeability of residential property markets to exogenous influences is assessed. The project then looks at the urban mosaic in the growing Sunbelt migration city of Brisbane, Australia, over the boom period from 1998-2004. Locally, it conducts a case study and survey in one micro-location, seeking clues in transaction patterns (output), property system agents (components) and the information they use (feedback mechanisms). Finally, the project draws some relevant policy implications. Its key findings are that urban housing markets are open, complex and polarised. In an exuberant economic climate, migration and debt fuel metropolitan price escalation. Public urban initiatives reinforce central incumbent affluence or spark fresh bouts of speculation. Individual premia are heterogeneous but often feed off local construction projects or iconic refurbishment. Reflecting their demographics and motives, agent risk appetites are diverse although investors are usually less averse to renewal. System feedback involves a congruence of media and local activity signals. Neither local conviviality nor Bohemian influences are, by themselves, significant. Rather, buyer rationality is validated by post-purchase infrastructure completions. The thesis of this project is, hence, that in euphoric capital markets, migration and debt accelerates the endogenous mutation of property from homes within a community towards speculative paper assets. The implication is that the excessive proliferation of premia indicates economic imbalance and urban malaise which requires recognition and treatment. While premia are paid for perceived privilege or prospects, cognitive risk representations and expectations evolve. Sometimes judgment is contaminated by media fantasy but often validated by accommodating government policy and central revitalisation projects. Yet, within a wider social and ecological remit, rampant premia suggest flaws in urban strategy, governance and planning practice. In terms of windfall events or unearned rent, the cumulative effects of ill-considered projects and price distortions can be ugly and wasteful. They alienate and accentuate spatial privilege without generating sustainable jobs. The project has procedural and substantive policy implications. The dynamics of residential premia cannot be disentangled from capital market volatility, urban fragmentation and reconstitution. Enlightened property development requires visionary urban planning beyond electoral cycles. Rather than unregulated markets or disjointed incrementalism, the project points to the advantages of cohesive projects and inclusive hubs. It impels ecological and people-focused development to nurture capable, connected and considerate edge communities. Its first steps are theoretical recognition, policy clarification, government reform, market constraints, price and tax rationalisation and spatial transparency.",

Since their establishment back in the 19th century, development banks have played a leading role in supporting development in many countries. Despite the liberalization process of the 1980s and 1990s, development banks have continued to play an active role in financing development in the case of many countries. In the Turkish case, the performance of development banking in supporting development has varied over time. However, one feature has remained constant: development and investment credits did not contribute to the alleviation of regional imbalances even during the period of import substituting industrialization from the 1960s to 1979. Moreover, total fixed capital investments, which are the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for development banking in Turkey, have been mainly financed by commercial banks.

It extends the traditional literature in two respects. First, it is international in scope, examining the accounting disclosure responses of multi-national companies to the pressures implied by the nature and scope of their operations. Second, variables measuring political risk and social development are developed so that these pressures can be measured, thereby introducing new dimensions to the literature. In common with previous studies, financial risk, size and other control variables are included. The relationships are tested econometrically utilising regression techniques not previously applied in the CSD literature but nonetheless more generally appropriate when using count dependent variables. Our results suggest that managers feel an unequal sense of responsibility to different constituencies and their disclosure priorities are determined by stock market accountability, lobbying power of their domestic audience and the political risk of their activities rather than the impact of their activities in countries of operation.",

This book discusses the international aspects of the petroleum industry, the operations in different countries with diversified social values and concerns, and their influence on Multi-National Companies\u2019 (MNCs) Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD).",

        "abstract": "Despite the great achievement of three decades of economic reform, theChinese banking sector takes the blame for its dysfunctional system,especially the large amount of non-performing loans. The ease of foreignbanks\u2019 entry set by the WTO from December 2007 raises our concern of thecapability of domestic banks to compete against foreign Asian banks. Thisstudy attempts to address this issue by measuring the cost efficiency of tenmajor Asian banking industries from 1998 to 2005 using panel datastochastic frontier approaches. Based on our preferred consistent paneldata estimating models, the higher cost efficiency score from includingcross-country environmental variables suggests that differences betweencountries can explain part of the inefficiency. We also find that the overallcost efficiency level of Chinese commercial banks ranks in the fifth place,suggesting that Chinese banks still need to strengthen their ability incompetition. Some policy implications are also suggested.",

        "abstract": "This study explores and empirically investigates and classifies the major reverseculture shock aspects, difficulties that Syrian returning academics encounter once they come back to their sending universities, and their previous cultural exposure when they studied abroad. The data is collected using a questionnaire developed for the purpose of this study and distributed to more than one hundred academics who returned within the past 49 months to Damascus University. Seventy eight academics responded. From the perspective of newly appointed academic staff, the questionnaires basically investigate the extent of study abroad exposure, aspects of reveres cultural shock, and major difficulties academics face from the date of returning until the date of being a full member of academic staff. A cross-sectional comparative analysis based on personal information is accomplished. To further investigate the three dimensions of the study, both factor and cluster analysis are employed. The results are presented in a three dimensional grid models. This study is the first analytical study in this field in the Syrian higher education sector. However, it is limited to data collected from only one public university in Syria. Implicitly, the study highlights the importance of maintaining academic staff attheir institutions. It also provides suggestions and recommendations to university managers for better elimination of the high risk of brain drain in developing countries. ",

        "abstract": "Globalisation effects on higher education became a major conflicting dialogue around the world. Not all nations responded similarly to these effects, but for most of them, the growth and diversification in global markets and products increase the concerns and worries of the quality of educational human products. The accreditation and affiliation of international student degree turns into crucial national attempts to confront the challenges of global education. Based on the Syrian National Standard Medical Test, this paper looks at the accumulated experience in the Syrian Arab Republic, explains the country\u2019s practices in managing and assuring the quality of international medical education of returning graduates, and evaluates the national efforts paid in this context. First the paper assesses the size of the problem in Syria by providing and discussing some statistics provided by the candidates applying to the Syrian National Standard Medical Test. Then it empirically investigates the educational and other related characteristics of the candidates who failed passing the medical quality assurance procedures (including the test). The data is collected from the candidates\u2019 application records over a period of three years. The study further investigates how successful the test and the other related quality assurance procedures are on the light of the empirical test\u2019s results. The evaluation of the quality assurance procedures is done by interviewing some of the key Syrian higher education players. This study is the first academic study tackling the response of Syrian higher education sector towards globalisation concerns. The study highlights the difficulties encountered by Syrian decision maskers in a number of dimensions including the political, the ethical and the social. It also gives suggestions and recommendations to better manage the issues of higher education fraud and corruption.",

The following results emerge: (i) the optimal debt is different for different model specifications and across different estimators; (ii) the quadratic model predicts that debt threshold occurs between 24%-46% debt-to-GDP ratio; (iii) Hansen\u2019s threshold model suggests that debt becomes detrimental to growth when debt-to-GDP ratio approaches 45%.",

The evidence shows that Turkish outward direct investments are mainly market oriented / horizontal FDI and are positively related to distance and to Turkish exports to the destination country.

It provides arguments for the government\u2019s active counterterrorism policy by presenting consequences of neglecting to respond. Consequently, authorities have to prepare a strategy which may be based on prevention or punishment-deterrence actions. The three phases of response, prevention, recovery and military operations, incur costs which are difficult to asses. Boosted public spending may be financed by expenditure switching, marginally balanced budgets or government borrowing. Nonetheless, all these methods impose threats on fiscal consolidation and evoke crowding out, spin-off and resource mobilization effects on the entire economy. ",

The paper moves beyond the traditional literature in two respects. First it is international in scope, examining the accounting disclosure responses of multi-national companies to the pressures implied by the nature and scope of their operations. Second, variables measuring political risk and social development are developed so that these pressures can be measured, thereby introducing new dimensions to the literature. In common with previous studies, financial risk, size and other control variables are included. The relationships are tested econometrically utilising regression techniques not previously applied in the CSD literature but nonetheless more generally appropriate when using count dependent variables. Results suggest that managers feel an unequal sense of responsibility to different constituencies and their disclosure priorities are determined by stock market accountability, lobbying power of their domestic audience and the political risk of their activities rather than the impact of their activities in countries of operation.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the causal links between human capital, openness through trade and FDI, and economic growth using quarterly data for Thailand over the period 1973:2-2000:4. A number of hypotheses are investigated including, in particular, FDI-led growth and export-led growth, as well as the reverse linkages from growth to FDI and exports. The importance of human capital is highlighted as complementary to trade and FDI inflows, underlying the importance of technology adoption. We find that, after controlling for domestic investment, government expenditure and imports, support for FDI-led growth is not as strong as export-led growth, although allowing for the joint interaction of FDI and human capital reveals a positive FDI effect above a minimum threshold of human capital, estimated to be around 4.5 years of average secondary schooling attainment. Extending our study using multivariate causality tests conducted within a vector error correction framework, we also find significant effects of domestic investment and trade openness, providing support for import-led growth, but direct support for FDI-led growth as well as growth-led FDI is again relatively weak, reinforcing the conclusion that trade openness has played a more significant role than FDI in influencing Thai economic growth. But the results reveal a subtle role for technology transfer through the complementary effect of trade on FDI, and FDI on government expenditure, which thereby influences human capital development with spillovers onto domestic investment and growth. This leads us to argue that there is a potential role for FDI interacting with human capital in influencing the future development of the Thai economy, given its recently active policy of FDI promotion.",

        "abstract": "We investigate boardroom governance using UK historical data for 1935. We demonstrate that there is a negative relationship between risk and incentives in this year. Prior research has produced anomalous results (Prendergast, 2002). Second, we show that average (median) board ownership of ordinary shares is about 7.95% (2.88%). Heuristically this figure is less than previously reported estimates for the US also using 1935 data. Finally, we show the phenomenon of multiple board membership. UK directors in 1935 hold many directorships - sometimes exceeding 10 concurrent memberships.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the sources of Thai economic growth over the period 1972:1-2000:4 using both growth accounting and level accounting approaches, allowing explicitly for the contribution of human capital accumulation. The accumulation of human capital in Thailand is measured by the average years of schooling in population age 25-64, and we assess its relative contribution alongside physical capital accumulation and labour force growth. The rate of growth of human capital increased significantly in the period 1972:1-2000:4. We find that, after incorporating human capital, the Solow growth residual is positive and significant during the pre crisis period 1972-1996. Disaggregating our analysis over five year periods reveals a productivity slowdown with negative contribution from capital, labour, and human capital during the period 1997-2000. We conclude that both productivity growth and factor accumulation are significant in accounting for Thai growth performance during the pre and post crisis period.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the relative performance of a small number of public and private firms in Thailand. The main aim is to assess recent privatisation efforts in Thailand by examining the influence of ownership on performance. The empirical investigation is initially focused on a matched-pair combination of (public vs. private) firms, mainly in the insurance and banking sectors, but later we also examine the performance of a small number of recently privatised organisations, mainly in the commercial sector. Additionally, we estimate by pooled regression the productivity of labour and capital for an extended group of firms in the financial services industry, and explain the public-private factor productivity differences derived thereof. Although we find some basic underlying efficiency differences between the two groups of firms, it is hard to attribute such differences purely to ownership as other factors like market competition might have played a part. This leads us to argue that efficiency gains from on-going privatisation efforts in Thailand may not be realised without adequate measures designed to promote competition.",

We have sought to highlight the spatial \u201ctwo-tier\u201d nature of the information society and the regional (centre-pheriphery) disparity among the EU economies, revealing the factors, other than economic, which also contributed to the North-South divide pervading the EU.",
